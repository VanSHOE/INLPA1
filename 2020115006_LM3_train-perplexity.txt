a yellow <unk> ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air	2.38020367649271
he held the bowl aloft and <unk> — introibo ad altare dei	2.189551484257853
halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out <unk> —come up kinch	2.2759121891146923
come up you fearful jesuit	1.4757449566183343
solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains	2.341907378859729
then <unk> sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head	2.8058331965860566
stephen dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light <unk> hair <unk> and <unk> like pale oak	2.321954250288982
buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly	2.231931264177167
he added in a <unk> tone —for this o dearly beloved is the genuine <unk> body and soul and blood and ouns	2.667915999196352
a little trouble about those white <unk>	1.6397881019594582
he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points	2.420318900435741
two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm	1.6652328985922031
—thanks old chap he cried briskly	1.7957595059760116
that will do nicely	1.3824684336170556
switch off the current will you	1.6986338729294717
he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown	2.3473223562801984
the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages	2.29251983575725
a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips	1.7424092306060668
your absurd name an ancient greek	1.6059156134321757
he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself	2.3146041649473212
stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck	2.4244620170823286
buck mulligan’s gay voice went on	1.5249639832645214
—my name is absurd too malachi mulligan two <unk>	1.8207274583275046
but it has a hellenic ring hasn’t it	1.8212062271816158
tripping and sunny like the buck himself	1.7722896663710872
we must go to <unk>	1.539068538686783
will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid	2.259737994367087
he laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried —will he come	2.393126805762149
ceasing he began to shave with care	2.0589922973567605
—tell me mulligan stephen said quietly	1.5808510049211753
—how long is haines going to stay in this tower	1.9716338355683276
buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder	1.8449320742666313
—god isn’t he dreadful	1.337432270973828
he thinks you’re not a gentleman	1.1968482135473542
god these bloody english	1.2285391132790608
bursting with money and <unk>	1.5488360091119548
because he comes from oxford	1.7670937675332175
you know dedalus you have the real oxford manner	2.2372898644030212
he can’t make you out	1.5800397346071247
o my name for you is the best kinch the knife blade	2.531868317894711
he shaved warily over his chin	1.6060129968399932
—he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said	2.029431147428711
where is his <unk>	1.326265380713679
were you in a funk	2.072253175485045
—i was stephen said with energy and growing fear	2.178306087897023
i’m not a hero however	2.160168425183581
if he stays on here i am off	2.0944676091298082
buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade	2.0394489290216824
he <unk> down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily	2.064343721071824
he came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into stephen’s upper pocket said <unk> us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor	2.972768976365771
stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief	2.6176383585749434
buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly	1.6467111617095909
then gazing over the handkerchief he said —the bard’s noserag	2.2610975785727345
a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen	2.0163165188370105
you can almost taste it can’t you	1.8733617639122886
he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay his fair <unk> hair stirring slightly	2.542671518683374
isn’t the sea what algy calls it a great sweet mother	2.07481021654346
ah dedalus the greeks	1.3372516164329933
i must teach you	1.1794925523432727
you must read them in the original	2.2791193410139963
she is our great sweet mother	1.3562579605024951
stephen stood up and went over to the parapet	2.247398261831735
leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the <unk> of kingstown	4.6309689420918
he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen’s face	2.4958449362746618
that’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you	2.144766235758923
—someone killed her stephen said gloomily	1.7184566716761396
—you could have knelt down damn it kinch when your dying mother asked you buck mulligan said	2.0482627357631586
i’m <unk> as much as you	2.244208308025547
but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her	2.5345051599642834
there is something sinister in you	1.5485071112661384
he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek	2.0382688245615848
a <unk> smile curled his lips	1.7589697279818037
—but a lovely mummer	1.383657430997807
he murmured to himself	1.2284889199112476
kinch the <unk> mummer of them all	2.018528760979717
he shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously	2.042209056477923
stephen an elbow rested on the <unk> granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the <unk> edge of his shiny black coat sleeve	3.231656055214051
pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart	2.3082496865067217
silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes	1.938665832825087
across the <unk> <unk> he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the <unk> voice beside him	4.809746201194338
the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid	2.2044004019959775
a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her <unk> liver by fits of loud groaning <unk>	2.6484226421773673
buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade	1.7931366773881592
he said in a kind voice	2.939598694907233
i must give you a shirt and a few <unk>	2.5449985379349718
how are the secondhand <unk>	1.7381019238095952
—they fit well enough stephen answered	1.5599977139321732
buck mulligan <unk> the hollow beneath his underlip	2.481571823713117
—the mockery of it he said <unk>	2.411912816365854
<unk> they should be	1.2103628216507347
god knows what <unk> <unk> left them off	2.6000616078636405
i have a lovely pair with a hair <unk> grey	2.700993477436906
you’ll look spiffing in them	1.3462709857845871
i’m not joking kinch	1.1986560354702485
you look damn well when you’re dressed	1.8501123260561443
i can’t wear them if they are grey	2.166796267230792
—he can’t wear them buck mulligan told his face in the mirror	2.3105820894868927
he kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers	2.0776761163042634
stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its <unk> mobile eyes	3.1968013071355563
—that fellow i was with in the ship last night said buck mulligan says you have g	2.7790093298433654
he’s up in <unk> with connolly norman	2.6899688762034133
general paralysis of the insane	1.4852079547858292
he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea	2.4639486315012675
his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth	2.0963746242657884
laughter seized all his strong <unk> trunk	1.7803322216111914
—look at yourself he said you dreadful bard	2.158175633319587
stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack	2.6869507783981335
as he and others see me	1.6928880672111062
who chose this face for me	1.5623617499560019
this dogsbody to rid of vermin	1.4534268751097223
it asks me too	1.299731563750307
—i pinched it out of the <unk> room buck mulligan said	3.186621906591789
it does her all right	1.514615913432304
lead him not into <unk>	1.5136935417173834
and her name is ursula	1.7496243278169052
laughing again he brought the mirror away from stephen’s peering eyes	2.3989030837727903
—the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said	2.301506985826584
if wilde were only alive to see you	1.8187942539810225
drawing back and pointing stephen said with bitterness —it is a symbol of irish art	2.15646510040334
the cracked lookingglass of a servant	1.0761026647940874
buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen’s and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them	2.51034379330716
—it’s not fair to tease you like that kinch is it	2.0219117930896036
god knows you have more spirit than any of them	2.17273299661099
he fears the <unk> of my art as i fear that of his	3.194341721391823
the cold steel pen	1.4469106161246774
<unk> lookingglass of a servant	1.1008397046752139
tell that to the <unk> chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea	3.274146529671871
he’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman	1.6813920435874963
his old fellow made his tin by selling <unk> to <unk> or some bloody swindle or other	3.2842156234377606
god kinch if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island	2.622297780579558
—and to think of your having to beg from these swine	2.35230796001311
i’m the only one that knows what you are	2.2237413119632894
why don’t you trust me more	1.906007234579414
what have you up your nose against me	2.2745091800076938
young shouts of moneyed voices in clive <unk> rooms	2.747855727913696
palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another	1.7988396023060311
o i shall expire	1.376268311963261
break the news to her gently <unk>	1.814488684088998
with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by <unk> of magdalen with the tailor’s shears	3.162277660168379
a scared calf’s face gilded with <unk>	1.5279269651652947
i don’t want to be <unk>	1.6932042619554863
don’t you play the giddy ox with me	1.879646480911899
shouts from the open window <unk> evening in the <unk>	2.160672654147685
a deaf gardener aproned masked with matthew arnold’s face pushes his <unk> on the sombre lawn watching <unk> the dancing <unk> of grasshalms	2.5018013306645837
—let him stay stephen said	1.3204802200584926
there’s nothing wrong with him except at night	1.9416797513917397
—then what is it	1.268722872654956
buck mulligan asked impatiently	1.4597952081128138
i’m quite frank with you	1.3746728144891027
what have you against me now	2.0849748864632867
they halted looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale	2.548034456650539
stephen freed his arm quietly	1.537655803308312
—do you wish me to tell you	1.8297536769204499
i don’t remember anything	1.4433917438858574
he looked in stephen’s face as he spoke	2.0575010222798156
a light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes	2.19807824707692
stephen <unk> by his own voice said —do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother’s death	3.169230528641024
buck mulligan frowned quickly and said —what	1.9623302326886918
i can’t remember anything	1.2215313838456268
i remember only ideas and sensations	1.4982715443552819
what happened in the name of god	1.8768550143524523
—you were making tea stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water	2.4842637071207787
your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom	3.0297918129728796
she asked you who was in your room	2.7648454040069406
what did i say	1.5454187619638802
—you said stephen answered o it’s only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead	1.8342797917607454
a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligan’s cheek	2.1688380007457964
—did i say that	1.321636815320993
what harm is that	1.2131386940708222
he shook his <unk> from him nervously	2.3012555702009627
—and what is death he asked your mother’s or yours or my own	2.0693786800518787
you saw only your mother die	1.6928505544276378
i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the <unk>	2.3184427091060713
it’s a beastly thing and nothing else	1.7355895750190233
it simply doesn’t matter	1.208959977164539
you wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you	2.275212369853301
because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you only it’s injected the wrong way	2.3534084570815255
her cerebral lobes are not functioning	1.594701933811996
she calls the doctor sir peter <unk> and picks <unk> off the quilt	2.5307397280006145
humour her till it’s over	1.486579792035483
you crossed her last wish in death and yet you <unk> with me because i don’t <unk> like some hired mute from <unk>	2.637716489179181
i suppose i did say it	2.0430367002125323
i didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother	3.3083451916207407
he had spoken himself into boldness	1.5905934948777314
—of the offence to me stephen answered	2.0288277899980116
buck mulligan swung round on his heel	1.7556432586242317
—o an impossible person	1.210516111817899
he walked off quickly round the parapet	1.7265037852115555
stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland	2.124705703957971
sea and headland now grew dim	1.4840464662354016
pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks	2.7284849536033744
a voice within the tower called loudly —are you up there mulligan	2.1346374855631027
—i’m coming buck mulligan answered	1.3357061696731076
he turned towards stephen and said —look at the sea	2.513476997819993
what does it care about <unk>	1.6930727799392826
chuck loyola kinch and come on down	1.8436788797111772
the sassenach wants his morning rashers	1.5080749964475586
his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof —don’t <unk> over it all day he said	2.6903934452220324
give up the moody brooding	1.5221061001547405
his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead and no more turn aside and brood upon love’s bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars	2.398886522942805
<unk> floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed	2.1605192889478912
<unk> and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by <unk> hurrying feet	2.272510006638102
white breast of the dim sea	1.7110666282037896
the twining <unk> two by two	1.5128233991012991
a hand plucking the <unk> <unk> their twining chords	3.5403343110147616
<unk> wedded words shimmering on the dim tide	1.7338384865641638
a cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green	1.6482694977861727
it lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters	2.056517422349703
<unk> song i sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords	2.89559309845273
her door was open she wanted to hear my music	2.356299844674911
silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside	2.3344887061270407
she was crying in her wretched bed	1.7313398190738911
for those words stephen love’s bitter mystery	1.5745661830136841
her secrets old <unk> tasselled <unk> powdered with <unk> a <unk> of amber beads in her locked drawer	2.7983100802303267
she heard old <unk> sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang i am the boy that can enjoy <unk>	2.7525113290513055
<unk> mirth folded away <unk>	1.4132049004525504
folded away in the memory of nature with her toys	2.464385794926009
memories <unk> his brooding brain	1.5239222585770476
a <unk> apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening	2.52403316090322
her shapely <unk> reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts	2.234671429618726
in a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes	1.9161561124123758
her <unk> eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul	2.419132842706706
the <unk> to light her agony	2.947005781950907
ghostly light on the tortured face	1.7954153427422446
her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees	1.980671917660308
her eyes on me to strike me down	2.1942812758377346
liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat	3.0670576681064103
let me be and let me live	2.4134250709360967
buck mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower	1.7291074626518754
it came nearer up the staircase calling again	2.2615722178262954
stephen still trembling at his soul’s cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words	2.851521206862064
—dedalus come down like a good mosey	2.5452045757671846
haines is <unk> for waking us last night	1.8767383350403477
—do for <unk> sake buck mulligan said	1.964394972831942
for my sake and for all our <unk>	2.283812622776939

or leave it there all day forgotten friendship	2.061603712131128
he went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy <unk> of the lather in which the brush was stuck	3.593813663804627
so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes	2.014796548335394

a server of a servant	1.5286037974900584
in the gloomy domed <unk> of the tower buck mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow	2.9954575096263567
two shafts of soft daylight fell across the <unk> floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning	2.658920292474062
—we’ll be choked buck mulligan said	1.336671459269675
haines open that door will you	1.5688022505708379
stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker	1.8867361551180657
a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors	3.028433689717747

the key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered	2.45269932487964
haines stood at the doorway looking out	2.0304843864327613
stephen <unk> his <unk> valise to the table and sat down to wait	3.5897395859596974
buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him	2.4480829413142673
then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief	2.8955369594568654
—i’m melting he said as the candle remarked when	2.34812713584259
not a word more on that subject	1.9847741362628488
bless us o lord and these thy gifts	1.9574864571051442
stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the <unk> from the locker	3.0464532108341174
buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet	2.4424678076186677
—what sort of a kip is this	2.3779609682207186

buck mulligan cried jumping up from his chair	2.2907436856536862

but i say mulligan you do make strong tea don’t you	2.1149897205818946
buck mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old woman’s wheedling voice —when i makes tea i makes tea as old mother grogan said	2.4449285423866094
and when i makes water i makes water	2.310212394398357

printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind	2.328976843930422
he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows —can you recall brother is mother grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the <unk>	2.473705525109505
—i doubt it said stephen gravely	1.8163344569181192
—i fancy stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion	3.297226281805589
mother grogan was one imagines a <unk> of mary ann	3.1022175457075263
buck mulligan’s face smiled with delight	1.6355710958632108
he said in a <unk> sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly	3.125947790619408

then suddenly <unk> all his features he growled in a <unk> <unk> voice as he <unk> again vigorously at the loaf —for old mary ann she doesn’t care a damn	3.162277660168379
but hising up her petticoats	1.6032564970658005
he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned	2.0388193912616828
the doorway was darkened by an entering form	1.7615685977371798
—come in ma’am mulligan said	1.330882430273143
kinch get the jug	1.3988732257234655
an old woman came forward and stood by stephen’s elbow	2.622214775700296
—that’s a lovely morning sir she said	1.6524663744720987
glory be to god	1.0559020516865607
mulligan said glancing at her	1.5385871739382468
ah to be sure	1.385424077857904
stephen reached back and took the <unk> from the locker	2.860520706278448
—the <unk> mulligan said to haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces	2.414453176234198

—i am ma’am buck mulligan answered	1.5347273540650337
—look at that now she said	1.8341772265876652
stephen listened in scornful silence	1.407164486187148
she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her <unk> her <unk> me she <unk>	3.0033402279285166
to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins of man’s flesh made not in god’s likeness the <unk> prey	2.6719696398517065
and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes	2.4881207575766657
—is it french you are talking sir	1.8813660158222325
the old woman said to haines	1.9439362829793152
haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently	2.332603391151959
—irish buck mulligan said	1.3641862424458706

—i am an englishman haines answered	1.617839319690184
—he’s english buck mulligan said and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland	2.6048237406309207
—sure we ought to the old woman said and i’m ashamed i don’t speak the language myself	2.7223124929665232
i’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows	2.150837401407184

would you like a cup ma’am	2.32001207933405
—no thank you sir the old woman said slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go	2.46660375482318
haines said to her —have you your bill	2.3783497041467947
we had better pay her mulligan hadn’t we	1.8870222203311517
stephen filled again the three cups	1.766737649369438
well it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three <unk> is a shilling	2.501732650198239
that’s a shilling and one and two is two and two sir	2.647312944965078
buck mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets	2.1700135732684225
<unk> up and look pleasant haines said to him smiling	2.9108892559363433
stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk	2.117002512143335
buck mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried —a miracle	2.5609618319115337
he passed it along the table towards the old woman saying —ask nothing more of me sweet	2.68854153629365
stephen laid the coin in her <unk> hand	2.810423853385793
—we’ll owe twopence he said	1.2018007528518708
<unk> enough sir she said taking the coin	2.161806028914947
she <unk> and went out followed by buck mulligan’s tender chant —heart of my heart were it more more would be laid at your feet	2.522437859934796
hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money	2.1421758538876294
today the bards must drink and <unk>	1.4738117362319791
ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty	2.0512005813868623
—that reminds me haines said rising that i have to visit your national library today	2.615270932606377
—our swim first buck mulligan said	1.3464493415285512
he turned to stephen and asked blandly —is this the day for your monthly wash kinch	2.2673503659680856
then he said to haines —the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month	2.7884036014018485
—all ireland is washed by the gulfstream stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf	2.1826703526238607
haines from the corner where he was <unk> easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke —i intend to make a collection of your <unk> if you will let me	2.761699813343848
they wash and tub and scrub	1.5679716359068552
yet here’s a spot	1.3374391282646039
—that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good	2.0268965616535
buck mulligan kicked stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone —wait till you hear him on hamlet haines	2.5463836950344185
—well i mean it haines said still speaking to stephen	2.101652562724788
i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in	2.6495678158636786
—would i make any money by it	1.8377872177324726
haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the <unk> of the hammock said —i don’t know i’m sure	3.703914732857211
buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour —you put your hoof in it now	2.462250759063771
what did you say that for	2.277397256789544
the problem is to get money	1.794320818738032
from the <unk> or from him	4.40565092094149
it’s a toss up i think	1.6073618763580269
—i blow him out about you buck mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy <unk> and your gloomy jesuit jibes	2.733706914221245
—i see little hope stephen said from her or from him	2.0888741571556877
buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen’s arm	2.712558474745504
—from me kinch he said	1.3644037546798369
in a suddenly changed tone he added —to tell you the god’s truth i think you’re right	2.468514894338409
why don’t you play them as i do	2.5024275164316925
to hell with them all	1.7106322054629257
let us get out of the kip	3.1942324543171003
he stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly <unk> is stripped of his garments	2.5219785420248155
he <unk> his pockets on to the table	2.826917546479935
—there’s your <unk> he said	1.6591179186075682
and putting on his stiff collar and <unk> tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain	2.554455602740382
his hands plunged and <unk> in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief	3.2475765049634844
god we’ll simply have to dress the character	1.6774398531019916
i want puce gloves and green boots	1.6630184277171132
do i contradict myself	1.028243044614023
very well then i contradict myself	1.5317048016607615
a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands	2.513705962040946
—and there’s your latin quarter hat he said	1.727716132662396
stephen picked it up and put it on	2.4580121695773993
haines called to them from the doorway —are you coming you fellows	2.393064276594012
you have eaten all we left i suppose	1.3763183701201824
<unk> he passed out with grave words and gait saying <unk> with sorrow —and going forth he met butterly	2.503681980554064
stephen taking his ashplant from its <unk> followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it	3.019584311681012
he put the huge key in his inner pocket	2.2353036232569568
at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked —did you bring the key	2.229496371770548
—i have it stephen said preceding them	2.1615328104584193
behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy <unk> the leader shoots of ferns or grasses	2.3290352154687812
how dare you sir	1.0633430254995617
haines asked —do you pay rent for this tower	1.8616983406222796

—to the secretary of state for war stephen added over his shoulder	1.7155322414570884
they halted while haines <unk> the tower and said at last —rather bleak in wintertime i should say	2.305937539396362
martello you call it	1.1813757945147256
<unk> <unk> had them built buck mulligan said when the french were on the sea	2.5684316138576584
but ours is the omphalos	1.518686894769231
—what is your idea of hamlet	1.8885917842772433
—no no buck mulligan shouted in pain	1.5826194235008793
i’m not equal to thomas aquinas and the <unk> reasons he has made out to <unk> it up	3.437332373449528
wait till i have a few pints in me first he turned to stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat —you couldn’t manage it under three pints kinch could you	2.610157215682537
—it has waited so long stephen said listlessly it can wait longer	2.0062341939267583
is it some paradox	1.3541640547782483
we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes	1.7464888783589765
haines said beginning to point at stephen	1.7102250061319249
buck mulligan slung his towel <unk> round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to stephen’s ear —o shade of kinch the elder	2.3526352466380627
—we’re always tired in the morning stephen said to haines	2.6336528070548932
and it is rather long to tell	2.2117400212671527
buck mulligan walking forward again raised his hands	1.7847327608397847
—the sacred pint alone can <unk> the tongue of dedalus he said	1.9835236178823161
—i mean to say haines explained to stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of <unk>	2.450321978964408
that beetles o’er his base into the sea isn’t it	1.8471177678737114
buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak	2.3729457827113176
in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay <unk>	2.2275539619251763
—it’s a wonderful tale haines said bringing them to halt again	2.00824387789924
eyes pale as the sea the wind had <unk> paler firm and prudent	2.399568776342357
the seas’ ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the <unk> of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail <unk> by the <unk>	2.914035601542371
—i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said <unk>	2.181161314961893
the father and the son idea	2.787546853817705
the son <unk> to be <unk> with the father	4.038837002338407
buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face	2.014469105946179
he looked at them his <unk> mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety	2.925728421003672
he moved a <unk> head to and fro the <unk> of his panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice —i’m the <unk> young fellow that ever you heard	2.761699813343848
my mother’s a jew my father’s a bird	1.5772990861344953
with joseph the joiner i cannot agree	1.6230994293178196
so here’s to <unk> and calvary	2.694844651813723
he held up a forefinger of warning	2.0287824926797917
—if anyone thinks that i amn’t divine he’ll get no free drinks when i’m making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again	2.4624229105807163
he tugged swiftly at stephen’s ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like <unk> or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted <unk> now goodbye	2.3713737056616555
write down all i said and tell tom dick and harry i rose from the dead	2.4304082621521457
what’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and <unk> <unk>	2.008558582445709
he <unk> before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his <unk> hands leaping nimbly <unk> hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries	2.5734102049702914
haines who had been laughing <unk> walked on beside stephen and said —we oughtn’t to laugh i suppose	2.597983450461669
i’m not a believer myself that is to say	2.12570304547988
still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesn’t it	2.2887521396248003
what did he call it	2.2672144648615706
—the ballad of joking jesus stephen answered	1.6000711192554213

she cried running to lap	1.5081451174213893
he watched the bristles shining <unk> in the weak light as she tipped three times and <unk> lightly	3.100665444638489

or kind of feelers in the dark perhaps	2.2428917922611635
he listened to her licking lap	1.7401937887625538

while the kettle is boiling	1.3109490808086113
she lapped slower then licking the saucer clean	1.7631330819432016

he glanced round him	1.206792932548842
on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall paused by the bedroom door	2.842111508540043
she might like something tasty	1.6765960643309212
thin bread and butter she likes in the morning	2.082809206061003

be back in a minute	1.9928463276678263
and when he had heard his voice say it he added —you don’t want anything for breakfast	3.142675183929405
a sleepy soft grunt answered <unk>	1.4515580171613303
she didn’t want anything	1.3489318546929763
he heard then a warm heavy sigh softer as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the <unk> jingled	3.171698278260558
must get those settled really	1.6364875409755533

the incumbent they called him	1.4078294566249123
he felt it incumbent on him to say a few words	2.6810193745323843
but one should be charitable	1.5268002972622896
they acted according to their lights	1.6131116001223942
father conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular road	2.3032146612628686
it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare	3.2975244748213512
surely there ought to be	1.072617953902087
a band of <unk> schoolboys crossed from richmond street	1.8501062429655777
father conmee greeted them more than once <unk>	2.0082523257028124

virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered	1.75667433503435
near <unk> house father conmee thought of that <unk> nobleman	2.2643963792672923
and now it was an office or something	1.920564234566133
father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop	2.7700708128234086
father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from <unk> and ample cools of butter	2.4095070738594493
he passed grogan’s the <unk> against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in new york	2.197550956491193
in america those things were continually happening	1.6651498110101037
unfortunate people to die like that <unk>	1.901419329020678
still an act of perfect contrition	1.7871667331940373
father conmee went by daniel bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two <unk> men lounged	2.5166333138654746
they saluted him and were saluted	1.7626019652840454

moored under the trees of <unk> mall father conmee saw a <unk> a <unk> with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated <unk> smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him	2.543345761304649
it was <unk> and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people	2.232735148777284
on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s	1.5615680762115927

of saint <unk> church north william street on to newcomen bridge	2.246992975809677
at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island	2.271738990849151
passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket	2.1810797975386924
the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap	2.519245986046229
father conmee liked cheerful decorum	1.3607222097102483
it was a peaceful day	3.119378374718641
the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down	2.0414738079461014
his wife father conmee supposed	1.478771232897495
a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses	2.23493191819769
she raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gently <unk> her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily sweetly	2.1979948658731234
father conmee perceived her perfume in the car	1.714433954249169
he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat	2.763563448014892
father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head	2.4857789773691112
at <unk> bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight	3.088555506838337
the conductor pulled the <unk> to stay the car for her	2.941910750616169
she passed out with her basket and a marketnet and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and father conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you my child that they have been <unk> pray for me	1.715437896342879

from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick <unk> at father conmee	1.9202676424918055
father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver s	2.2362990660338435
and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the <unk> of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night	2.321954250288982
that book by the <unk> jesuit le <unk> des <unk> seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea	2.7172472494092403
those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not d	2.573152861080748
but they were god’s souls created by god	1.658179909903581
it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say	2.5992199620806606
at the howth road stop father conmee alighted was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn	2.185483033064695
the malahide road was quiet	1.3892410930542598
it pleased father conmee road and name	1.7478357762103693
the joybells were ringing in gay malahide	1.6438837967574202
then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day	2.6959628985487147
those were old <unk> days loyal times in joyous <unk> old times in the barony	2.104992428499033
father conmee walking thought of his little book old times in the barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary <unk> daughter of lord molesworth first countess of belvedere	2.610157215682537
a listless lady no more young walked alone the shore of lough <unk> mary first countess of belvedere listlessly walking in the evening not <unk> when an <unk> plunged	2.456987832455676

only god knew and she and he her husband’s brother	2.114577755756517
father conmee thought of that <unk> <unk> needed however for man’s race on earth and of the ways of god which were not our ways	3.0251170499687277
don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore	2.4102068609313694
he was humane and honoured there	1.4710255238025334
he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a <unk> drawingroom <unk> with full fruit clusters	2.7895263605284675
and the hands of a bride and of a <unk> noble to noble were <unk> by don john conmee	2.978127411637322
it was a charming day	3.264734430927649
the <unk> of a field showed father conmee <unk> of cabbages curtseying to him with ample <unk>	3.269746855812582

a just and homely word	1.470265736519683
father conmee reading his office watched a flock of <unk> clouds over rathcoffey	2.048826351933199
his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field	1.934340654424287
he walked there reading in the evening and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play young cries in the quiet evening	2.5254318154527153
he was their <unk> his reign was mild	1.9123820692220617
father conmee drew off his gloves and took his <unk> breviary out	2.1372050115892143
an ivory bookmark told him the page	1.7768058319267404
he should have read that before lunch	2.121870504447516
but lady maxwell had come	1.420113040472387
father conmee read in secret pater and ave and crossed his breast deus in adiutorium	2.022828136644961

the young man raised his cap abruptly the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig	2.0194776802609495

it’s only a natural phenomenon don’t you see because on account of the	2.301105392317855
and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon	2.951966877350123
so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of <unk> and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by <unk> <unk> and a new ireland and new this that and the other	1.6265507027536246

an animated altercation in which all took part ensued among the f	1.9779449971582894

the arrival of the <unk> <unk> was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more <unk> foreign delegates <unk> vociferously in a medley of cries <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vive allah amid which the ringing <unk> of the delegate of the land of song a high double f recalling those <unk> lovely notes with which the eunuch <unk> <unk> our <unk> was easily <unk>	1.5160826983319609

hard by the block stood the grim figure of the <unk> his visage being concealed in a <unk> pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes <unk> furiously	3.162277660168379
on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife the various finely tempered <unk> <unk> specially supplied by the <unk> firm of <unk> messrs john round and sons <unk> a <unk> <unk> saucepan for the reception of the <unk> <unk> blind <unk> and <unk> etc when <unk> extracted and two commodious <unk> <unk> to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim	1.6618362775387496
the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when <unk> to that beneficent institution	3.2627694404679373
quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs fried steak and onions done to a <unk> delicious hot breakfast rolls and <unk> tea had been <unk> provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he with an abnegation rare in these our times rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish immediately acceded to that the meal should be divided in <unk> parts among the members of the sick and <unk> <unk> association as a token of his regard and esteem	1.361220783576622
the <unk> and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake	2.154434690031884
the hero folded her <unk> form in a loving embrace murmuring <unk> <unk> my own	2.6033977000734607
encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable <unk> of his person which the <unk> of prison garb permitted her <unk> to reach	3.162277660168379
she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever <unk> his memory that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a <unk> match in <unk> park	1.9429496147158305
she brought back to his recollection the happy days of <unk> childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and oblivious of the dreadful present they both laughed heartily all the spectators including the venerable <unk> joining in the general merriment	1.9429496147158305
that monster audience simply rocked with delight	1.5647925446010902
but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time	2.125677686871933
a fresh torrent of tears burst from their <unk> <unk> and the vast concourse of people touched to the inmost core broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the aged <unk> himself	2.761699813343848
big strong men officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record <unk>	2.4244620170823286
a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford <unk> noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex stepped forward and presenting his visiting card <unk> and genealogical tree solicited the hand of the <unk> young lady <unk> her to name the day and was accepted on the spot	1.9952623149688797
every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful <unk> of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young <unk> the <unk> by the way of one of the most timehonoured names in <unk> history placed on the finger of his blushing <unk> an expensive engagement ring with <unk> set in the form of a <unk> shamrock the excitement knew no bounds	1.5160826983319609
nay even the stern <unk> lieutenantcolonel tomkin maxwell <unk> <unk> who presided on the sad occasion he who had blown a considerable number of <unk> from the <unk> without flinching could not now restrain his natural emotion	2.543345761304649
with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard by those privileged <unk> who happened to be in his immediate entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering <unk> —god blimey if she aint a <unk> that there bleeding tart	2.192345972483447
blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down <unk> way	2.429248714345402
so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the <unk> that can’t speak their own language and joe <unk> in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old <unk> with his <unk> stump that he <unk> off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink the curse of ireland	1.6265507027536246
antitreating is about the size of it	1.733670207934808
gob he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint	2.4911464074705876
and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my <unk> lay and there was a fellow with a <unk> blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen <unk> going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob <unk> entertainment don’t be talking	1.539926526059492
ireland sober is ireland free	1.3905104229199734
and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of	2.585927059870207
and one or two sky <unk> having an eye around that there was no <unk> on with the females hitting below the belt	2.774279376693215
so <unk> as i was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me	2.9611307297645686
i’d train him by kindness so i would if he was my dog	2.952382671446857
give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him	2.491764392868506
says the citizen jeering	3.197529361408136
but he might take my leg for a <unk> so he calls the old dog over	3.4617083665109325
—what’s on you garry	1.4047993443733802
then he starts <unk> and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling letting on to answer like a duet in the opera	3.138207207642958
such growling you never heard as they let off between them	2.1819905229573613
someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono <unk> to the papers about the <unk> order for a dog the like of that	3.1175101844813353
growling and <unk> and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the <unk> dropping out of his jaws	4.8063808630643905
all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of <unk> given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the <unk> of garryowen and recently <unk> by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry	1.7455628235338618
the exhibition which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully <unk> dietary system <unk> among other <unk> the recitation of verse	2.583152386452454
our greatest living <unk> expert wild horses shall not drag it from us	1.9681245136039822
has left no stone <unk> in his efforts to <unk> and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance the italics are ours to the <unk> of ancient celtic bards	2.761699813343848
we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who <unk> his identity under the graceful <unk> of the little sweet branch has familiarised the <unk> world but rather as a contributor d	2.4816289228368253
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening <unk> of the <unk> and more personal note which is found in the <unk> effusions of the famous <unk> and of <unk> <unk> to say nothing of a more modern <unk> at present very much in the public eye	2.023589647725157
we <unk> a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication	2.2758459260747883
perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if <unk> verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed <unk>	2.361147586257559
the curse of my <unk> seven days every day and seven dry <unk> on you barney kiernan has no <unk> of water to cool my courage and my guts red roaring after lowry’s lights	2.761699813343848
and joe asked him would he have another	2.183860150405832
—i will says he a chara to show there’s no ill feeling	2.2330380373537886
gob he’s not as green as he’s <unk>	1.8716489996356918

—could a swim duck	1.2158365423137691
—same again terry says joe	1.2071373227372049

as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham don’t you see about this insurance of poor dignam’s	2.562083596556102
martin asked me to go to the house	2.8946066747924335
you see he dignam i mean didn’t serve any notice of the <unk> on the company at the time and <unk> under the act the <unk> can’t recover on the policy	3.046989570903508
<unk> wars says joe laughing that’s a good one if old shylock is landed	2.242818541703436
so the wife comes out top dog what	1.8593058672119789
—well that’s a point says bloom for the wife’s admirers	2.2943064557731283
—the wife’s advisers i mean says bloom	1.9615779626218492
then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed <unk> the money and if now the wife or the widow <unk> the <unk> right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act	1.5947870582948211

o <unk> me to an <unk>	1.864928365150835
royal and privileged hungarian robbery	1.5099325534270795
so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer a finer than poor little willy that’s dead to tell her	1.8529220216409523
choking with bloody <unk>	1.1832713347203399
and shaking bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that	1.9782733847242973

—let me said he so far presume upon our acquaintance which however slight it may appear if <unk> by the standard of mere time is founded as i hope and believe on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour	2.192345972483447
but should i have <unk> the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness	2.5149213121107628
—no rejoined the other i <unk> to the full the motives which <unk> your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that though the errand be one of sorrow this proof of your confidence <unk> in some measure the bitterness of the cup	1.968419447286612
the goodness of your heart i feel sure will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose <unk> were i to give vent to my feelings would <unk> me even of speech	2.232735148777284
and off with him and out trying to walk straight	2.582962486108346
boosed at five o’clock	1.223310597134355
night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby a	2.226914209965523

they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets building <unk> as children do or playing with their big coloured ball happy as the day was long	2.459910099653605
and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight	2.4820179565344582
he was but eleven months and nine days old and though still a tiny <unk> was just beginning to <unk> his first <unk> words	2.9284018183138842
cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty <unk> in his chin	3.0821488377908453

and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother	2.419893606006728
but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and master jacky	2.6657521722582707
boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule	2.2785306349533623
the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be <unk> improved by a <unk> like the martello tower had	2.4244620170823286
but if master tommy was <unk> master jacky was selfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little irishman’s house is his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe <unk> came to grief and alas to relate	2.154434690031884
—come here tommy his sister called <unk>	1.7271162201055263
and you jacky for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand	2.083307340952862

his eyes misty with <unk> tears master tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins	2.321316741822223
and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure	2.995228825620267
his little man o’ war top and <unk> were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of <unk> over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit	2.192345972483447
still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the <unk> and shook her hand at master jacky the <unk> and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him her eyes dancing in admonition	2.1187853261287715
she put an arm round the little mariner and <unk> <unk> —what’s your name	3.0685756737843444

cissy’s quick motherwit <unk> what was <unk> and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes	2.6826957952797255
but who was gerty	1.4062389032803615
gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions lost in thought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see	2.4162845633627104
she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as <unk> often said she was more a giltrap than a macdowell	2.6810022800682325
her figure was slight and graceful <unk> even to <unk> but those iron <unk> she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow <unk> female pills and she was much better of those <unk> she used to get and that tired feeling	1.968419447286612
the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its <unk> <unk> though her <unk> mouth was a genuine <unk> bow <unk> perfect	2.995208261726898
her hands were of finely <unk> alabaster with <unk> fingers and as white as <unk> and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk <unk> either	2.2758459260747883
bertha supple told that once to edy boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty the girl chums had of course their little <unk> from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again	1.715437896342879
honour where honour is due	1.3868358645112344
there was an innate refinement a languid queenly <unk> about gerty which was <unk> <unk> in her delicate hands and higharched instep	2.9121606325136535
had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician <unk> at her feet vying with one another to pay their <unk> to her	1.6378937069540642
mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent to her <unk> face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaning that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist why have women such eyes of <unk>	2.1187853261287715
gerty’s were of the <unk> irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows	3.0318217208638747
time was when those brows were not so <unk> <unk>	2.1288527877944188
it was madame <unk> <unk> <unk> of the woman beautiful page of the princess <unk> who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion and she had never regretted it	2.232735148777284
then there was blushing <unk> cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose	2.6428530506523065
that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one	2.4934451081431064
but gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair	1.8465175170880819
it was dark brown with a natural wave in it	2.1088874531249653
she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it <unk> about her pretty head in a <unk> of <unk> clusters and pared her nails too thursday for wealth	2.761699813343848
and just now at edy’s words as a <unk> flush delicate as the faintest <unk> crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish <unk> that of a surety god’s fair land of ireland did not hold her equal	2.2758459260747883
she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue	2.304582025229973
inclination <unk> her to speak out dignity told her to be silent	2.919973808689815
the pretty lips <unk> awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the <unk> of a young may morning	3.162277660168379
she knew right well no one better what made squinty edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel	2.4837421599349936
as per usual <unk> nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window	2.8497723981239202
only now his father kept him in in the evenings <unk> hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother w	2.1187853261287715
wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university	2.071823550683905
little <unk> he perhaps for what she felt that dull <unk> void in her heart sometimes piercing to the core	2.6481251779530854
yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time	2.494314592802881
they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph	2.8524596056412177
but he was <unk> handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so <unk> clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden	1.3809784956898055
gerty was dressed simply but with the <unk> taste of a <unk> of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out	3.290344562312668
a neat blouse of electric blue <unk> by dolly <unk> because it was expected in the lady’s pictorial that electric blue would be worn with a smart <unk> opening down to the division and kerchief pocket in which she always kept a piece of <unk> scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection	1.6050163175336876
she wore a <unk> little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an <unk> of <unk> chenille and at the side a <unk> bow of silk to tone	2.942727176209282
all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clery’s summer sales the very it slightly <unk> but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny	2.4244620170823286
she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her	2.6840822094305876
and when she put it on the <unk> to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew	3.775053205324394
her shoes were the newest thing in footwear edy boardman <unk> herself that she was very <unk> but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell a five and never would ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart <unk> over her higharched instep	2.085205857248754
her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in <unk> hose with <unk> heels and wide garter tops	2.5458614598736995
as for <unk> they were gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her	2.610157215682537
she had four <unk> sets with awfully pretty <unk> three garments and <unk> extra and each set <unk> with different coloured ribbons rosepink pale blue mauve and <unk> and she <unk> them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and <unk> them and she had a <unk> to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those <unk> as far as she’d see them <unk> the things	1.6265507027536246
she was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a friday	1.361220783576622
and yet and yet	1.305589859413646
that <unk> look on her face	1.850085528384537
a gnawing sorrow is there all the time	1.598629863496545
her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the <unk> of her own familiar chamber where giving way to tears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror	1.9429496147158305
you are lovely gerty it said	1.5074264912606867
the <unk> light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and <unk>	2.2012269969875113
gerty macdowell yearns in vain	1.346894317087254

he was too young to understand	2.1979025252758646
he would not believe in love a woman’s <unk>	2.49214002068552
the night of the party long ago in <unk> he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips	2.761699813343848
but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about <unk>	3.543802097856226
strength of character had never been reggy <unk> strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men	2.622175877324682
but waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over	2.7122767735816398
no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightly <unk> with grey and who would understand take her in his <unk> arms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss	1.6265507027536246
it would be like heaven	2.261814477915664

and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be	2.7797546204213273
then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face bertha supple too and edy little <unk> because she would be twentytwo in november	2.9965395770892216
she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of <unk>	2.4265654003560346
he would be tall with broad shoulders she had always admired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the <unk> for their honeymoon three wonderful weeks	2.4244620170823286
and then when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning they would both have <unk> simple but perfectly served for their own two <unk> and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes	1.79571449437164
edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little <unk> for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight	2.321954250288982
but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it <unk> be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if you please	1.968419447286612

o he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of <unk>	2.816478038773708
edy told him no no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him	3.305478793336421
—you’re not my sister naughty tommy said	1.6612296479535078
but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career having won the day	2.4816289228368253
<unk> for a quiet life laughed ciss	2.5331849938018305
and she tickled tiny <unk> two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor here’s his two horses here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin	2.5575864890952653

—on the <unk> laughed cissy merrily	1.722164485763965
gerty macdowell bent down her head and <unk> at the idea of cissy saying an <unk> thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say <unk> a deep rosy red and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said	2.053525026457146
but not a pin cared ciss	1.762382724270282
she said with a pert toss of her head and a <unk> tilt of her nose	3.287822351795728
give it to him too on the same place as quick as i’d look at him	3.2751972137339784
<unk> ciss with her <unk> curls	2.290063791661593
for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and <unk> ram and when she drew the <unk> too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white	1.7615770326037883
that was just like <unk>	1.926787593431779
o and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road smoking a cigarette	2.6086490611538746
there was none to come up to her for fun	1.827582679376483
but she was sincerity itself one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of your <unk> things too sweet to be wholesome	2.9633066660637155
and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the <unk> anthem of the organ	3.547108094482657
it was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the <unk> the reverend john hughes s	3.396483947383968
rosary sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament	2.1131509795841015
they were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most <unk> spectacle it was to see in that simple <unk> beside the waves after the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet of the immaculate reciting the <unk> of our lady of <unk> <unk> her to <unk> for them the old familiar words holy mary holy virgin of virgins	1.715437896342879
how sad to poor gerty’s ears	1.6493284639786165
had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink by taking the pledge or those <unk> the drink habit cured in <unk> weekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none	2.5309115230869743
but that vile <unk> which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days	2.210578371500409
nay she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by <unk> and had seen her own father a prey to the fumes of <unk> forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low	1.6265507027536246
and gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish <unk> or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk	2.232735148777284
with all his <unk> she loved him still when he sang tell me mary how to woo thee or my love and cottage near <unk> and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with <unk> salad dressing for supper and when he sang the moon hath raised with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried god have mercy on him from a stroke	1.7301957388458942
her mother’s birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken	2.848035868435802
no one would have thought the end was so near	2.4805717961153606
a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house a <unk> angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold	3.2122611021991467
and when her mother had those raging <unk> <unk> who was it rubbed the <unk> cone on her forehead but gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking <unk> of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about taking snuff	2.154434690031884
everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways	2.5017623895395196
it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who <unk> up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the <unk> of lime mr <unk> the grocer’s christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a <unk> hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his <unk> with <unk> chivalry through her lattice window	1.5483652565854986
you could see there was a story behind it	2.614185362968455
the colours were done something lovely	1.50978776889194
she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat	2.955741307278819
the twins were now playing in the most approved <unk> fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that <unk> kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the <unk> rocks	2.192345972483447
needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but <unk> the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and <unk> the ball	2.848035868435802
our two champions claimed their <unk> with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please	2.8806279407780275
the gentleman <unk> the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock	2.543345761304649
the twins <unk> again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed	1.968419447286612
—if you fail try again edy boardman said	1.6356299982238418
gerty smiled assent and bit her lip	1.5748048595165325
a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the <unk>	1.8738174228603839
pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking	2.976054015347723
she felt the warm flush a danger signal always with gerty macdowell <unk> and flaming into her cheeks	2.237540836757283
till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemed to her the <unk> she had ever seen	1.9952623149688797
through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray for us vessel of singular <unk> pray for us mystical rose	2.085205857248754
and careworn hearts were there and <unk> for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary the most pious virgin’s <unk> power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her	1.566048452832833
the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers	2.055555803331064
cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air	2.0969422296395956
peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah	2.6941115255344084
and my word didn’t the little chap enjoy that	1.9452528589039007
and then she told him to say papa	3.00872153036613
say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa	1.096757057516965
and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said	2.085205857248754
<unk> ja ja <unk>	1.1776444040722218
cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out holy saint denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him	2.023589647725157
of course his infant majesty was most <unk> at such toilet <unk> and he let everyone know it <unk> <unk> <unk>	2.8768218052585386
and two great big lovely big tears <unk> down his cheeks	2.081601865971432
gerty wished to goodness they would take their <unk> baby home out of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats of twins	2.9353827655855556
she gazed out towards the distant sea	1.904577808765138
it was like the <unk> that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft	1.6744824380115346
and while she gazed her heart went <unk>	1.8861066497710564
yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look	3.8023178038461314
his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through read her very soul	2.2913549814255583
wonderful eyes they were <unk> expressive but could you trust them	2.5255383125142425
people were so queer	1.3858243176096998
she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a <unk> the image of the photo she had of martin harvey the <unk> idol only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t <unk> like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an <unk> nose or a slightly <unk> from where he was sitting	1.539926526059492
he was in deep mourning she could see that and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face	3.363724942890908
she would have given worlds to know what it was	2.9479207976894712
he was looking up so intently so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down	2.4816289228368253
she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away	2.7594977850671527
here was that of which she had so often dreamed	2.978798401337715
it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no one else	3.593813663804627
the very heart of the <unk> went out to him her <unk> because she knew on the instant it was him	4.079683929604748
if he had suffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had been himself a sinner a wicked man she cared not	2.7525575762927845
even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her	2.8285051737780864
there were wounds that wanted healing with <unk>	1.6536446438610999
she was a womanly woman not like other <unk> girls <unk> he had known those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forget the memory of the past then mayhap he would embrace her gently like a real man crushing her soft body to him and love her his <unk> <unk> for herself alone	1.5753186734235158
well has it been said that <unk> prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven <unk> which <unk> her own heart	2.232735148777284
gerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glass windows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin’s sodality and father conroy was helping canon o’hanlon at the altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down	2.053525026457146
he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a <unk> nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the <unk> of saint dominic	2.053525026457146
he told her that time when she told him about that in confession <unk> up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws he said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god he said and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word	1.4677992676220695
he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a <unk> <unk> with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty <unk> <unk> because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place	1.4277072840416294
the <unk> little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it	2.6780347123683352
little monkeys common as <unk>	1.2388957085917198
someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of them	2.8681458766811274
and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned	3.0534407995452324
what a great notion they had	1.8174352430436629
so cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out	3.062633011681269
she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the <unk> she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it	1.701254279852589
she ran with long <unk> strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good <unk> she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible	1.4942339672143998
it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble	2.6826957952797255
that would have been a very charming <unk> for a gentleman like that to witness	3.8211464604469554
queen of angels queen of <unk> queen of <unk> of all saints they prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon o’hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon o’hanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the <unk> <unk> <unk> tum	1.2589254117941673
three and eleven she paid for those stockings in <unk> of george’s street on the tuesday no the monday before easter and there wasn’t a <unk> on them and that was what he was looking at transparent and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form the cheek of her	1.9187520990478337
because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself	3.6334268562945593
cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a <unk> tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature	1.7455628235338618
gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier a daintier head of <unk> <unk> was never seen on a girl’s <unk> radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening in its <unk>	2.4244620170823286
you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that	2.6535295398877445
she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve	2.6957338377344335
she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes	2.7695787082777943
he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey	2.0278463609115867
her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose	2.610157215682537
edy boardman was <unk> it too because she was squinting at gerty half smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse the baby	2.7669412416977703
<unk> little <unk> she was and always would be and that was why no one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers	3.162277660168379
and she said to gerty —a penny for your thoughts	2.3865419686061196
replied gerty with a smile <unk> by the whitest of teeth	3.1603039098240466
because she wished to goodness they’d take the <unk> twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late	2.761699813343848
and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy as <unk> as you like said it was half past kissing time time to kiss again	3.1450767171763467
but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early	3.102003230644668
—wait said cissy i’ll run ask my uncle peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum	2.2389676986945624
so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with his watchchain looking up at the church	2.6826957952797255
passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous <unk> over himself	3.3611302423872984
one moment he had been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet <unk> gentleman <unk> expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure	2.848035868435802
cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set	1.79571449437164
his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured <unk> there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow <unk>	2.9781990940315093
cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order	2.5793229935670525
then they sang the second verse of the tantum ergo and canon o’hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time	1.5570684047537309
it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets	2.2758459260747883
she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon	2.023589647725157
his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every <unk> literally <unk> at her <unk>	2.341162435591813
it is for you gertrude macdowell and you know it	2.4212401021964927
edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the <unk> caps and <unk> their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o’hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out <unk> de <unk> <unk> eis and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she <unk> about her best boy throwing her over	1.2731955290816555
a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn <unk>	2.2690334077802476
it <unk> yes it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the <unk> little cat she was	2.8648230435537463
gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so <unk> so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of	2.4165098831491614
she had loved him better than he knew	1.7924161264257223
<unk> deceiver and <unk> like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick <unk> of tears	2.848035868435802
their eyes were <unk> her <unk> but with a brave effort she <unk> back in sympathy as she glanced at her new <unk> for them to see	3.4520886416258243
—o responded gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud head flashed up	2.1342299287903015
i can throw my cap at who i like because it’s leap year	2.043749305916271
her words rang out <unk> more musical than the cooing of the <unk> but they cut the silence <unk>	3.3207628100248656
there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly <unk> with	3.1924798845591495
as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much <unk> and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces	2.053525026457146
and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him <unk> up on the spot	2.9763482894406668
miss puny little edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it the little <unk> because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something <unk> apart in another sphere that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it	1.4556047973707602
edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the <unk> was on his way for master boardman junior	2.4816289228368253
and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go <unk> and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleeful eyes and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat <unk> and baby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to all and <unk> on to his brandnew dribbling bib	1.6744824380115346
he has his bib destroyed	1.6986979931753896
the slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights	2.132924632930794
gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate <unk> by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet <unk> because canon o’hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands	1.4384498882876628
how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse of erin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the <unk> belfry through the dusk hither thither with a tiny lost cry	2.192345972483447
and she could see far away the lights of the <unk> so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of <unk> because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book the lamplighter by miss cummins author of <unk> vaughan and other tales	1.4677992676220695
for gerty had her dreams that no one knew of	2.1891743885556063
she loved to read poetry and when she got a <unk> from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her <unk> which though it did not err on the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean	1.9187520990478337
it was there she kept her girlish treasure <unk> the tortoiseshell combs her child of mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine her alabaster <unk> and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in hely’s of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the <unk>	1.4277072840416294
art thou real my ideal	1.3885362298874901
it was called by louis j walsh <unk> and after there was something about twilight wilt thou ever	3.199152865697205
and <unk> the beauty of poetry so sad in its <unk> loveliness had <unk> her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her one by one and but for that one <unk> she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it	1.7455628235338618
but it must end she felt	1.7037314913974928
if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her	2.6836678885303398
love laughs at <unk>	1.211503252167825
she would make the great sacrifice	1.8822633163255194
her every effort would be to share his thoughts	1.9300484002000589
dearer than the whole world would she be to him and <unk> his days with happiness	3.5700274747542324
there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse cruel only to be kind	1.9429496147158305
but even <unk> then	1.3847867062512067
would it make a very great difference	2.1550878028489633
from everything in the least <unk> her <unk> nature instinctively <unk>	3.324759042518867
she <unk> that sort of person the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour <unk> the sex and being taken up to the police station	2.2758459260747883
no no not that	1.343820149470433
they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the <unk> of society with a big ess	3.593813663804627
perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall	2.948662417133273
she thought she understood	1.5736353235264313
she would try to understand him because men were so different	2.0929806513275064
the old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes	2.269711323812566
she would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide	2.610157215682537
come what might she would be wild <unk> free	2.1505151084957013
canon o’hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and <unk> and the choir sang <unk> dominum omnes <unk> and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and <unk> edy asked wasn’t she coming but jacky caffrey called out —o look cissy	1.8329807108324359
and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church blue and then green and purple	2.8023442487826333
—it’s fireworks cissy caffrey said	1.365260288921719
and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church helterskelter edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running	2.4244620170823286
—come on gerty cissy called	1.3886480438527604
it’s the bazaar fireworks	1.3049712295511884
but gerty was <unk>	1.3149708399406375
she had no intention of being at their beck and call	2.271746123428226
if they could run like <unk> she could sit so she said she could see from where she was	2.8716569247699737
the eyes that were <unk> upon her set her pulses tingling	2.618346303146367
she looked at him a moment meeting his glance and a light broke in upon her	2.4972433414310973
whitehot passion was in that face passion silent as the grave and it had made her his	2.82337778053935
at last they were left alone without the others to <unk> and pass remarks and she knew he could be <unk> to the death steadfast a sterling man a man of <unk> honour to his fingertips	2.610157215682537
his hands and face were working and a <unk> went over her	3.2289373745683383
she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully <unk> legs like that supply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passion of men like that hotblooded because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman <unk> that was staying with them out of the congested <unk> board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed	1.2798022139979537
but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips	2.543345761304649
besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too my dear and winny rippingham so mad about <unk> photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did	1.5848931924611136
and jacky caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air a soft thing to and fro dark	1.6876124757881479
and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hush they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it high high almost out of sight and her face was <unk> with a divine an <unk> blush from straining back and he could see her other things too <unk> knickers the <unk> that <unk> the skin better than those other <unk> the green four and eleven on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous <unk> half offered like those skirtdancers <unk> so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking looking	1.1916319307657184
and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o	2.061208872613427
then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o	2.9179286276162757
and everyone cried o	1.2274789264086157
in <unk> and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah	3.2702118019762905
they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden o so lovely o soft sweet soft	2.271198107045148
then all <unk> away <unk> in the grey air all was silent	3.928548071356423
she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly a <unk> little glance of piteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl	2.67929333899563
he was leaning back against the rock behind	1.893854307718442
leopold bloom for it is he stands silent with bowed head before those young <unk> eyes	2.5423697417853384
what a brute he had been	1.569400462655917
a fair <unk> soul had called to him and wretch that he was how had he answered	3.3348221634203297
an <unk> cad he had been	1.5323886105599063
he of all men	1.4082251570112867
but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered	2.8647535188841022
should a girl tell	1.3989520963564561
no a thousand times no	1.4967972875996118
that was their secret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little <unk> don’t tell	2.4816289228368253
cissy caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried <unk>	2.771519348999893
we can see from farther up	1.837478912749358
gerty had an idea one of love’s little <unk>	2.028989968252607
she slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back	2.679204182949311
wonder if he’s too far to	1.495671071780881
she had to go but they would meet again there and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream of yester eve	3.04778358197875
she drew herself up to her full height	2.309690604715909
their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of a strange shining hung <unk> on her sweet <unk> face	3.0163797624767983
she half smiled at him <unk> a sweet <unk> smile a smile that <unk> on tears and then they parted	3.0852631398475037
slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey to little baby boardman	2.5804760029057245
it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and <unk> seaweed	2.656334795637613
she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly <unk> gerty macdowell was	2.8019826955973275
mr bloom watched her as she <unk> away	2.451780576688471
that’s why she’s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint	2.5235356053617872
thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib	2.040621860088365

chickens come home to roost they stick by one another like glue	2.241444742195872
maybe the women’s fault also	1.4514617178838385
it’s the blood of the south	2.0159646640904407
also the form the figure	1.6521828471106805

also that now is magnetism	1.6042414954942381
back of everything magnetism	1.5116221063748614
earth for instance pulling this and being pulled	1.9601794933230636
and time well that’s the time the movement takes	2.1613231450911043
then if one thing stopped the whole <unk> would stop bit by bit	2.3940753106312145
because it’s all arranged	1.3785263794919387
magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun the stars	2.6787016829611723

shame all put on before third person	1.6775638807848725
more put out about a hole in her stocking	2.3292005745427224
molly her underjaw stuck out head back about the farmer in the <unk> and spurs at the horse show	3.187473633004255

smell that i did	1.4035758091153683
came from the <unk> probably in the paint	3.230071960543945
make their own use of everything	1.6682594359125165
same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear	2.6343882833164494
but lots of them can’t kick the beam i think	2.0837078746311213
keep that thing up for hours	1.7652094624188774
kind of a general all round over me and half down my back	3.0142523761631415
why she waved her hand	1.4937966278750576
i leave you this to think of me when i’m far away on the pillow	2.5056112396172248
she’d like scent of that kind	1.6435383187597163
sweet and cheap soon sour	1.4782321352827132
why molly likes opoponax	1.2238264140141495

she was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before	2.648500701668238
good conductor is it	1.212954040183878
suppose there’s some connection	1.2292155508321512
for instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark	2.131175253066838
why did i smell it only now	2.09407639352687
took its time in coming like herself slow but sure	1.8454357002936033

and the traveller leopold was <unk> to him <unk> it had <unk> that they had had ado each with other in the house of <unk> where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be <unk> for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and <unk> as much as he might suffice	1.5570684047537309
and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there	2.9324447662248248
and the traveller leopold said that he should go <unk> for he was a man of <unk> and a <unk>	3.4967147454774183
also the lady was of his avis and <unk> the learningknight though she <unk> well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his <unk>	2.947423954957826
but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her <unk> ne have him in aught <unk> to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle	3.162277660168379
and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches <unk> in divers lands and sometime <unk>	2.489964676075426
and in the castle was set a board that was of the <unk> of <unk> and it was upheld by four <unk> of that country but they durst not move more for <unk>	2.848035868435802
and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great <unk> by <unk> <unk> out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of <unk> and stags that there <unk> <unk>	2.4816289228368253

and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could <unk> a fuller ne richer	2.4600342941688043
and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes <unk> heads though <unk> men <unk> that this be possible thing without they see it <unk> they are so	2.4244620170823286
and these fishes lie in an <unk> water brought there from portugal land because of the <unk> that therein is like to the juices of the <unk>	3.1341535715922255
and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a <unk> out of <unk> <unk> out of <unk> that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up <unk> like to a vast mountain	2.1187853261287715
and they teach the serpents there to <unk> themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a <unk> like to mead	2.942727176209282
and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and <unk> thereto the while all they that were there drank every each	2.2907824347018306
and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took <unk> somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full <unk> he <unk> the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour <unk> not of this <unk>	1.968419447286612
and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile	2.85289632536767
thanked be almighty god	1.1586011307530706
this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of <unk> our <unk> liege lord to leave their <unk> for there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time <unk> fast sir leopold heard on the <unk> cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it be not come or now	1.5947870582948211

and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the <unk> and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one <unk> and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently	1.9952623149688797
but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her <unk> for she hath waited marvellous long	2.8206444317027746
and the franklin that had drunken said expecting each moment to be her next	2.104901447935269
also he took the cup that stood <unk> him for him needed never none asking nor <unk> of him to drink and now drink said he fully <unk> and he quaffed as far as he might to their <unk> health for he was a passing good man of his <unk>	1.9952623149688797
and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in <unk> hall and that was the <unk> man and the <unk> that ever laid <unk> hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him <unk> in the cup	1.8738174228603839

now let us speak of that <unk> that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might	3.0405537168867167
there was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit dixon yclept junior of saint mary <unk> with other his fellows lynch and madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa one crotthers and young stephen that had mien of a <unk> that was at head of the board and costello that men <unk> punch costello all long of a mastery of him <unk> <unk> and of all them reserved young stephen he was the most drunken that <unk> still of more mead and beside the meek sir leopold	1.4077153669117268
but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his <unk>	2.5694868682465324
and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest <unk> <unk> as they <unk> him for that time in the <unk> manner	2.192345972483447
ruth red him love led on with will to wander loth to leave	2.0268766825779307
for they were right witty scholars	1.6388605283602946
and he heard their <unk> each <unk> other as touching birth and <unk> young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne’s house that now was <unk> out of this world and the self night next before her death all <unk> and <unk> had taken counsel of her case	1.6050163175336876
and they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die	2.232735148777284
and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other <unk> the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy	2.2758459260747883
a <unk> god grant	1.6089823902313423
this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our virgin mother the wife should live and the babe to die	2.41684240387568
in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack	2.4244620170823286
then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and <unk> and for a vow he had made to saint <unk> of <unk> her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved	1.9187520990478337
to whom young stephen had these words following murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk	2.046180362937268

we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we	2.0942461875805183
then said dixon junior to punch costello <unk> he what ends	2.0483409799886534
but he had <unk> drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever <unk> a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so <unk> him to be delivered of his spleen of <unk>	2.192345972483447
whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi’s praise of that beast the <unk> how once in the <unk> he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint <unk> his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do	1.715437896342879
thereat laughed they all right <unk> only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not <unk> and also for that he <unk> for her that bare whoso she might be or <unk>	2.154434690031884
then spake young stephen <unk> of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of <unk> of lilith patron of <unk> of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of <unk> mouth to mouth or as <unk> saith by the influence of the <unk> or by the reek of <unk> or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with <unk> <unk> or <unk> in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides	1.4806572771858608
he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was <unk> and how in all our holy mother <unk> ever souls for god’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a <unk> to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that <unk> the <unk> seal even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded	1.6496480740980204
all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so <unk> her person as risk life to save life	2.4843924364522243
a <unk> of mind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he said <unk> as his wont was that as it was informed him who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman and <unk> also with his experience of so <unk> an accident it was good for that mother church <unk> at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort <unk> he <unk> their questions	1.5753186734235158
that is truth <unk> said dixon and or i err a pregnant word	2.105911606265988
which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared <unk>	2.154434690031884
but sir leopold was passing grave <unk> his word by cause he still had pity of the <unk> shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was <unk> of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny	1.7455628235338618
and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil <unk> and for his burial did him on a fair <unk> of lamb’s wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie <unk> for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his <unk> happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived <unk> with those <unk> and murdered his goods with whores	1.3211974960367816
about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the <unk> had not shadowed their approach from him that still <unk> it very busily who praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray	1.7301957388458942

heard he then in that clap the voice of the god <unk> or what calmer said a hubbub of phenomenon	3.3922128609533613
why he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding which he had not done	2.9957664289950823
for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show	2.848035868435802
and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away	2.732451422400972
by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law	2.5995477721952347
then <unk> he nought of that other land which is called believe on me that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither <unk> nor <unk> at which all shall come as many as believe on it	1.8957356524063758
yes pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an <unk> exterior whose name she said is bird in the hand and she <unk> him <unk> from the true path by her <unk> that she said to him as ho you pretty man turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place and she lay at him so <unk> that she had him in her grot which is named two in the bush or by some learned carnal concupiscence	1.3938972755249328
this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in <unk> of mothers the most <unk> after and if they met with this whore bird in the hand which was within all foul <unk> monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her	1.8529220216409523
for regarding believe on me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for first two in the bush whither she <unk> them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four <unk> on which were four tickets with these words printed on them <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and cheek by jowl and second for that foul plague <unk> and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of <unk> and third that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named <unk>	1.357511017005077

with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was <unk> to sit near by which he did mighty brisk	1.6876124757881479

he took his ordinary at a <unk> and if he had but <unk> into him a mess of broken <unk> or a platter of tripes with a bare <unk> in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue some randy <unk> he had from a <unk> or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides	1.7615770326037883

there’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty <unk> that stood by which he had eyed <unk> in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his <unk> as he was <unk>	1.9429496147158305
mort <unk> <unk> says frank then in the french language that had been <unk> to a <unk> that has a <unk> in <unk> and he spoke french like a gentleman too	3.046989570903508
from a child this frank had been a <unk> that his father a headborough who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes <unk> at the university to study the <unk> but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the <unk> and the parish <unk> than with his volumes	1.6876124757881479
one time he would be a <unk> then a <unk> or a welsher then nought would keep him from the <unk> and the cocking main then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the <unk> folk <unk> a <unk> heir by favour of moonlight or fecking <unk> linen or choking chicken behind a hedge	1.7615770326037883

and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers greasy <unk> and <unk> wool having been some years before <unk> for mr joseph cuffe a worthy <unk> that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin low’s yard in prussia street	2.023589647725157

more like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue	1.7557887537661117
mr stephen a little moved but very <unk> told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief <unk> thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over doctor rinderpest the <unk> <unk> in all <unk> with a <unk> or two of physic to take the bull by the horns	1.8957356524063758
come come says mr vincent plain dealing	1.9494128058915183
he’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he <unk> with a bull that’s irish says he	3.0210516054833088
irish by name and irish by nature says mr stephen and he sent the ale purling about an irish bull in an english <unk>	2.4764875211234503
i conceive you says mr dixon	1.6676165445929563
it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas the bravest <unk> of them all with an emerald ring in his nose	2.711697448925073
true for you says mr vincent cross the table and a <unk> into the bargain says he and a plumper and a <unk> bull says he never shit on shamrock	3.162277660168379
he had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving <unk> and <unk> followed after him hanging his <unk> in <unk>	2.4244620170823286
what for that says mr dixon but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself	2.7980697542056348
so be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing and with that he slapped his <unk> very soundly	2.870970450426763
but the slap and the blessing stood him friend says mr vincent for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid wife <unk> and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a <unk> or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland	1.5160826983319609
another then put in his word and they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a <unk> and girdle and <unk> on his <unk> and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with <unk> oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s <unk>	1.5753186734235158
by this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to <unk>	2.913344853919125
to remedy which our <unk> dames and <unk> brought him his <unk> in their <unk> and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their <unk> a mystery and roar and <unk> out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him	1.9429496147158305
ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying by the lord harry green is the grass that grows on the ground	1.6744824380115346
and says mr dixon if ever he got scent of a <unk> in <unk> or the wilds of connemara or a <unk> in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of <unk> out he’d run amok over half the <unk> rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord <unk> orders	1.7615770326037883
there was bad blood between them at first says mr vincent and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old <unk> in the world and an old <unk> that kept seven <unk> in his house and i’ll <unk> in his matters says he	2.192345972483447
i’ll make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good <unk> my father left me	2.4527261461580685
but one evening says mr dixon when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a <unk> he had spade <unk> for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with <unk> he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a <unk> chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a <unk> descendant of the famous champion bull of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is good bog latin for boss of the show	1.4225293134853696
after that says mr vincent the lord harry put his head into a cow’s <unk> in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name	2.848035868435802
then with the water running off him he got into an old <unk> and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal <unk> which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a <unk> table or a <unk> of cotton or a <unk>	1.4384498882876628
in short he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt	2.4428944441106037
they were says mr stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was <unk> as the <unk> women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their <unk> of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect <unk> the yards sprang their <unk> <unk> to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor <unk> her helm ran up the jolly roger gave three times three let the <unk> run pushed off in their <unk> and put to sea to recover the main of america	1.4125375446227544
which was the occasion says mr vincent of the composing by a <unk> of that rollicking chanty <unk> <unk> but a <unk>	3.465684389843637

our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were <unk> their <unk> accompanied with a friend whom he had just <unk> a young gentleman his name alec bannon who had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or a <unk> in the <unk> and list for the wars	1.79571449437164
mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on	2.6826957952797255
whereat he handed round to the company a set of <unk> cards which he had had printed that day at mr <unk> bearing a legend printed in fair italics mr malachi mulligan	2.8265390026277535
his project as he went on to <unk> was to <unk> from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir <unk> <unk> and sir <unk> <unk> in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed	2.023589647725157
well let us hear of it good my friend said mr dixon	2.6059368473360935
i make no doubt it <unk> of <unk>	2.04356060761611
come be seated both	1.3007922197688309
’tis as cheap sitting as standing	1.5048317616808065
mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and <unk> upon his design told his <unk> that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility both the inhibitory and the <unk> whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal <unk> or to a <unk> of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired	1.6618362775387496
it grieved him <unk> he said to see the nuptial couch <unk> of its dearest <unk> and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich <unk> a prey to the <unk> <unk> who hide their <unk> under a <unk> in an <unk> <unk> or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some <unk> <unk> when they might multiply the <unk> of happiness <unk> the <unk> jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep	1.474142020110622
to curb this <unk> which he concluded due to a <unk> of latent heat having advised with certain <unk> of worth and inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the <unk> of lambay island from its holder lord talbot de malahide a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party	1.7782794100389228
he proposed to set up there a national <unk> farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the <unk> of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural	1.7782794100389228
money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains	2.6159000378627466
the <unk> <unk> no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their <unk> and their tempers were warm <unk> for their <unk> would find in him their man	3.046989570903508
for his nutriment he <unk> how he would feed himself <unk> upon a diet of savoury <unk> and fish and <unk> there the flesh of these latter <unk> rodents being highly <unk> for his purpose both <unk> and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of <unk> <unk>	1.9429496147158305
after this <unk> which he delivered with much warmth of <unk> mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had <unk> it	3.244686199977007
they both it seems had been <unk> by the rain and for all their <unk> their pace had taken water as might be observed by mr mulligan’s <unk> of a <unk> grey which was now somewhat piebald	2.543345761304649
his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty <unk> from all though mr dixon of mary’s excepted to it asking with a <unk> air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle	2.4816289228368253
mr mulligan however made court to the <unk> by an <unk> <unk> from the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his <unk> <unk> ac <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> o <unk> ut <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> while for those of <unk> wit he drove home his point by <unk> of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach the buck and <unk> of the forest <unk> the <unk> drake and duck	1.449740670372632

the young gentleman his friend overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him could not <unk> to tell it his nearest neighbour	3.294238828792187
mr mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and seeing the stranger he made him a civil bow and said pray sir was you in need of any professional assistance we could give	2.4244620170823286
who upon his offer thanked him very heartily though <unk> his proper distance and replied that he was come there about a lady now an inmate of horne’s house that was in an interesting condition poor body from woman’s woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place	1.8529220216409523
for answer mr mulligan in a gale of laughter at his <unk> <unk> himself bravely below the diaphragm <unk> with an admirable droll <unk> of mother grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a <unk> there’s a belly that never bore a bastard	2.053525026457146
the <unk> rattle had run on in the same vein of <unk> but for some <unk> in the antechamber	3.708082329035052
here the listener who was none other than the scotch student a little fume of a fellow blond as tow congratulated in the <unk> fashion with the young gentleman and <unk> the narrative at a salient point having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the <unk> to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a <unk> <unk> of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it	1.353876180022544
mais bien <unk> noble stranger said he cheerily et <unk> compliments	1.9364980389063136

with these words he approached the goblet to his lips took a <unk> draught of the cordial <unk> his hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk <unk> that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein	2.053525026457146
gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness ah monsieur he said had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty <unk> and her new <unk> cap a gift for her feastday as she told me <unk> in such an artless disorder of so melting a tenderness <unk> my conscience even you monsieur had been <unk> by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever	1.4873521072935114

thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours	2.1015512049248546
a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and having replaced the locket in his bosom he wiped his eye and sighed again	2.4504975297208267
beneficent <unk> of blessings to all thy creatures how great and universal must be that <unk> of thy <unk> which can hold in <unk> the free and the bond the simple <unk> and the polished <unk> the lover in the heyday of <unk> passion and the husband of maturer years	1.9952623149688797

i could weep to think of it	1.6662170420794866

but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the <unk> of our store of knowledge	3.05144897463092
amid the general vacant <unk> of the assembly a bell rang and while all were <unk> what might be the cause miss callan entered and having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon retired with a profound bow to the company	2.1187853261287715
the presence even for a moment among a party of <unk> of a woman <unk> with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the <unk> <unk> even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of <unk>	2.1187853261287715

in the sunny <unk> one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with <unk> fruit in them that <unk> sells in his booth near the bridge	2.5576952398884405
but she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she <unk> <unk> when i pressed too close	3.1271479416361156
a week ago she lay ill four days on the couch but today she was free blithe mocked at peril	2.136436811876297
she is more taking then	1.4580741636446815
mad romp that she is she had pulled her fill as we reclined together	2.407236582155888
and in your ear my friend you will not think who met us as we left the field	2.709821523654818
he was walking by the hedge reading i think a brevier book with i doubt not a witty letter in it from <unk> or <unk> to keep the page	2.9073399210813884
the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion feigning to <unk> a slight disorder in her dress a slip of underwood <unk> there for the very trees adore her	2.698472514088113
when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries	2.3349870664720447
but he had been kind	3.2061750621611087
in going by he had blessed us	2.044201102192023
the gods too are ever kind lenehan said	1.7004421478206568
if i had poor luck with bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more <unk>	2.4024878146334987
he was laying his hand upon a <unk> malachi saw it and withheld his act pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label	2.90113237790887
warily malachi whispered preserve a druid silence	1.540380125648081
his soul is far away	1.5247483169700577
it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born	2.4955502448852425
any object intensely regarded may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods	2.325697520695338
do you not think it stephen	1.8378736235226791
theosophos told me so stephen answered whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the <unk> of <unk> law	3.168027710356799
the lords of the moon theosophos told me an orangefiery <unk> from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not <unk> the etheric doubles and these were therefore <unk> by the <unk> <unk> from the second constellation	2.543345761304649
however as a matter of fact though the <unk> <unk> about him being in some description of a <unk> or other or <unk> which was entirely due to a <unk> of the <unk> character was not the case at all	2.3713737056616555
the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this <unk> commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as <unk> if not <unk> than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty <unk> in the wrong shop	2.085205857248754
during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass <unk> by messrs bass and co at burton on <unk> which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract <unk> remark on account of its scarlet appearance	1.7615770326037883
he was simply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings after the moment <unk> <unk> about <unk> days and the turf <unk> two or three private <unk> of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn	1.8139306939110624
eventually however both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the <unk> glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same time however a considerable degree of <unk> in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place	1.4330125702369627
the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an <unk> of the course of life	3.2970261026229517
neither place nor council was lacking in dignity	1.6281014489803247
the <unk> were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on the <unk> and most vital	3.7346411948347424
the high hall of horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old <unk> of that establishment ever listened to a language so <unk>	2.7254501882167523
a gallant scene in truth it made	1.6411129377214566
crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of <unk>	2.6427183689517544
there too opposite to him was lynch whose countenance bore already the <unk> of early <unk> and premature wisdom	3.0257546109441926
next the <unk> was the place assigned to costello the eccentric while at his side was seated in <unk> repose the squat form of madden	2.8256771210066023
the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in <unk> kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and <unk> manners of malachi <unk> st john mulligan	2.1187853261287715
<unk> at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of <unk> and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of <unk> discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the <unk> <unk> fresh from the <unk> and that vigilant <unk> soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an <unk> dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or <unk> or <unk> could ever <unk> the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has <unk> for ages yet to come	1.3938972755249328
it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted <unk> to which mr s	2.822748446896323
<unk> would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods	1.9621423662454474
science it cannot be too often repeated <unk> with <unk> phenomena	2.910500786032093
the man of science like the man in the street has to face <unk> facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can	2.584944583415777
there may be it is true some questions which science cannot <unk> <unk> as the first problem submitted by mr l	3.0270325366136546
regarding the future <unk> of sex	1.7520556492938963
must we accept the view of <unk> of <unk> that the right <unk> the <unk> period <unk> others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or <unk> the <unk> factors or is it as most <unk> incline to opine such as <unk> <unk> <unk> lusk <unk> leopold and <unk> a mixture of both	1.7782794100389228
this would be tantamount to a <unk> one of nature’s favourite <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position <unk> felix of the passive element	2.543345761304649
the other problem raised by the same <unk> is scarcely less vital infant mortality	2.3894021326345665
it is interesting because as he <unk> remarks we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways	3.1803831165329743
<unk> he <unk> would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life genuinely good music agreeable literature light philosophy instructive pictures <unk> <unk> of the classical statues such as venus and apollo artistic coloured photographs of prize babies all these little attentions would <unk> ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most <unk> manner	1.7301957388458942
<unk> some of these <unk> to abdominal trauma in the case of women <unk> subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect private or official culminating in the exposure of newborn infants the practice of criminal abortion or in the <unk> crime of infanticide	1.8139306939110624
<unk> the former we are thinking of neglect is undoubtedly only too true the case he <unk> of <unk> forgetting to count the sponges in the <unk> cavity is too rare to be <unk>	2.761699813343848
in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many <unk> and <unk> go off so well as they do all things considered and in spite of our human <unk> which often <unk> nature in her intentions	2.2758459260747883
an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v	2.0410931781264225
that both <unk> and mortality as well as all other phenomena of evolution tidal movements lunar phases blood temperatures diseases in general everything in fine in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the <unk> flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of <unk> as yet <unk>	1.7782794100389228
still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after <unk> <unk> in early childhood though other children of the same marriage do not must certainly in the poet’s words give us pause	2.192345972483447
nature we may rest assured has her own good and <unk> reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which <unk> in which <unk> germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend to <unk> at an increasingly earlier stage of development an arrangement which though <unk> of pain to some of our feelings notably the maternal is nevertheless some of us think in the long run <unk> to the race in general in <unk> thereby the survival of the fittest mr s	1.3768571648527583
remark or should it be called an <unk>	1.8306004926030635
that an omnivorous being which can <unk> <unk> <unk> and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such <unk> <unk> as <unk> females emaciated by <unk> <unk> professional gentlemen not to speak of <unk> <unk> and <unk> nuns might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob reveals as nought else could and in a very <unk> light the tendency above alluded to	1.6618362775387496
for the enlightenment of those who are not so <unk> acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal <unk> as this <unk> <unk> and <unk> philosopher who for all his <unk> <unk> in things scientific can scarcely <unk> an acid from an <unk> <unk> himself on being it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our <unk> licensed <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother	1.566048452832833
in a recent public <unk> with mr l	2.0013948709876934
which took place in the <unk> hall of the national maternity hospital <NUMBER> and <NUMBER> holles street of which as is well known dr a	2.7451802653801027

the tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow <unk> with their <unk> <unk> lay	2.7391726457031775
bloom holding in his hand stephen’s hat festooned with shavings and ashplant stands <unk>	2.5417678408847904
then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder	2.962498228908221
the name if you call	1.5449978434614327
somnambulist he bends again and hesitating brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form	2.3697422946883635
there is no answer	2.120895656654049
fergus now and pierce	1.3980845478251556
he bends again and undoes the buttons of stephen’s waistcoat	1.9128217180581966
he brushes the <unk> from stephen’s clothes with light hand and fingers	2.7236297953658033
he stretches out his arms sighs again and curls his body	2.0888443694571444
bloom holding the hat and ashplant stands erect	1.9352806603150008
a dog barks in the distance	1.54732020382027
bloom <unk> and <unk> his grip on the ashplant	3.49535802328349
he looks down on stephen’s face and form	2.074099779590451
bloom <unk> with the night	3.0951187586924216
face reminds me of his poor mother	1.8907784003879826

in the rough sands of the sea	1.6857150311683873
a <unk> length from the shore	1.642059075805135
where the tide <unk>	1.3151392591648545
silent thoughtful alert he stands on guard his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master	2.3478148668582968
against the dark wall a figure appears slowly a fairy boy of eleven a changeling <unk> dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet holding a book in his hand	2.491082148284964
he reads from right to left inaudibly smiling kissing the page	1.8063159057609672
bloom <unk> calls inaudibly	1.3336435087695884
rudy gazes unseeing into bloom’s eyes and goes on reading kissing smiling	2.0638555256497715
he has a delicate mauve face	2.3225626260538896
on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons	1.8577382609508404
in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot	2.1569148008141976
a white <unk> peeps out of his waistcoat pocket	2.9607021061894034
— iii — <NUMBER> preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and <unk> him up generally in orthodox <unk> fashion which he very badly needed	2.4244620170823286
his stephen’s mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their <unk> let alone drinking purposes hit upon an <unk> by suggesting off the reel the <unk> of the cabman’s shelter as it was called hardly a <unk> away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some <unk> in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral	1.4440241885954521
but how to get there was the rub	2.8296354039969787
for the nonce he was rather <unk> but inasmuch as the duty plainly <unk> upon him to take some <unk> on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned	2.761699813343848
so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being e	2.321954250288982
ed particularly stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found	2.682302389800835
accordingly after a few such <unk> as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather <unk> handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along beaver street or more properly lane as far as the <unk> and the distinctly <unk> atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of <unk> street where they made tracks to the left from thence <unk> into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin’s	1.5237960002208242
but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a <unk> plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a <unk> probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the north star hotel and there was no <unk> of its <unk> a quarter of an inch when mr bloom who was anything but a professional <unk> endeavoured to hail it by <unk> a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice	1.5483652565854986
this was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did	2.7446621440995362
so <unk> around by <unk> and the signal house which they shortly reached they proceeded <unk> in the direction of amiens street railway terminus mr bloom being handicapped by the <unk> that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to <unk> the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he <unk> made light of the <unk>	1.6618362775387496
so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent <unk> of jupiter <unk> they <unk> along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey	2.154434690031884
as it so happened a dublin united tramways company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man <unk> to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly <unk> escape of some little while back	2.543345761304649
they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station the starting point for belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very <unk> locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street famous for its c division police station	1.6378937069540642
between this point and the high at present unlit <unk> of beresford place stephen thought to think of <unk> associated with <unk> the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in talbot place first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his fidus achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourke’s city bakery situated quite close to where they were the very <unk> odour indeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable	1.5085907086001784
bread the staff of life <unk> your bread o tell me where is fancy bread at rourke’s the baker’s it is said	2.6955132184567816
en route to his <unk> and not to put too fine a point on it not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties never more so in fact <unk> sober spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swell <unk> which barely <unk> once in a while though not as a habitual practice was of the nature of a regular <unk> for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little <unk> for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out	1.318256738556407
highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was <unk> unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr <unk> or he being the solicitor rather old wall he meant to say or <unk> which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got <unk> about	1.4873521072935114
the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were <unk> <unk> in the service of the crown and as mr bloom put it recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot	1.8957356524063758
never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes	2.4816289228368253
another thing he commented on was <unk> soldiers with <unk> or <unk> of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to <unk> them against <unk> should by any chance they fall out over anything	2.4244620170823286
you <unk> away your time he very <unk> maintained and health and also character besides which the <unk> of the thing fast women of the <unk> ran away with a lot of £	2.848035868435802
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of <unk> he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and <unk> and possessing <unk> virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically	1.4942339672143998
most of all he commented <unk> on the desertion of stephen by all his <unk> <unk> but one a most glaring piece of <unk> on the part of his brother <unk> under all the <unk>	2.6826957952797255
—and that one was judas stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind	2.5819931131827945
<unk> these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps	2.2758459260747883
stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox	2.192345972483447
he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father’s gumley	2.4244620170823286
to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge	2.196050738745413
—someone saluted you mr bloom said	1.3257992143267012
a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling <unk>	2.077766549196619
stephen of course started rather <unk> and stopped to return the compliment	2.262490543431982
mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not <unk> in the least though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for <unk> who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad <unk> and generally <unk> <unk> pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper famished loiterers of the <unk> <unk> category they might be hanging about there or simply <unk> ready to <unk> with whatever <unk> they could in one fell <unk> at a moment’s notice your money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged and <unk>	1.2891222895981396
stephen that is when the <unk> figure came to close quarters though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley’s breath redolent of rotten <unk>	2.7292250009900783
lord john corley some called him and his <unk> came about in this wise	3.178874870830345
he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division lately deceased who had married a certain katherine brophy the daughter of a <unk> farmer	2.8828307063940675
his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine also talbot	2.3285804175480744
rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen	1.7782794100389228
this therefore was the reason why the still <unk> young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with <unk> proclivities as lord john corley	2.451018210906297
taking stephen on one side he had the customary <unk> ditty to tell	2.611113374347218
not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings	2.192598941018877
his friends had all deserted him	1.557704663466454
furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a <unk> of a number of other <unk> expressions	3.775053205324394
he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on god’s earth he could get something anything at all to do	3.128753203472291
no it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was <unk> to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish	1.9952623149688797
anyhow he was all in	2.199825572168976
<unk> be a job tomorrow or next day stephen told him in a boys’ school at dalkey for a gentleman usher	2.5426246308537923
you may mention my name	1.3783288573395347
—ah god corley replied sure i couldn’t teach in a school man	2.0640062269223822
i was never one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh	2.7082410838105404
i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers	1.9547489635588688
—i have no place to sleep myself stephen informed him	2.07299354569308
corley at the first go off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being <unk> out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street	2.942727176209282
there was a <unk> in marlborough street mrs <unk> but it was only a tanner touch and full of <unk> but <unk> told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in <unk> street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon for a bob	1.9429496147158305
he was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it	2.200418441318677
however <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the <unk> was demolished	1.8957356524063758
but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley’s head that he was living in <unk> and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful	2.942727176209282
he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for to his <unk> he found his cash missing	1.7615770326037883
he tried his <unk> to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact	2.610157215682537
he was altogether too fagged out to <unk> a thorough search though he tried to recollect	2.7332432913418216
about biscuits he <unk> remembered	1.537189148995179
who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy	2.225703406204595
however in another pocket he came across what he <unk> in the dark were pennies erroneously however as it turned out	3.3297097916558003
—those are halfcrowns man corley <unk> him	1.8448479223653127
and so in point of fact they turned out to be	1.910570387370783
stephen anyhow lent him one of them	1.7839861963386678
—thanks corley answered you’re a gentleman	1.5900915388778067
i’ll pay you back one time	1.588985889394819
who’s that with you	1.3600046260457714
i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan the billsticker	2.878694301462913
you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there	3.128016931133548
i’d carry a <unk> only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks man	2.8474356627160016
god you’ve to book ahead man you’d think it was for the <unk> rosa	2.9948532908910415
i don’t give a shite anyway so long as i get a job even as a crossing sweeper	2.6662066583257813
subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags <unk> that he said stephen knew well out of <unk> the <unk> <unk> there that used to be often round in nagle’s back with <unk> and a little chap with a <unk> the name of <unk>	1.7301957388458942
anyhow he was lagged the night before last and <unk> ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable	3.3518694281170487
he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephen’s anything but <unk> <unk> interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the <unk> idea when	2.085205857248754
being a <unk> individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very <unk> hat and <unk> wearing apparel generally <unk> to a chronic <unk>	2.6826957952797255
palpably he was one of his <unk> but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one <unk> on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal <unk> with or without the option of a fine would be a very <unk> avis altogether	1.6050163175336876
in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning	2.9057270947638014
pretty thick that was certainly	1.5316051923289162
the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who with his practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the <unk> of the other <unk>	3.290344562312668
alluding to the encounter he said <unk> stephen that is —he is down on his luck	2.666531137429928
he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichman	2.905117025881696
at this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest mr bloom gazed <unk> for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a <unk> <unk> in the farfamed name of eblana moored <unk> customhouse quay and quite possibly out of <unk> <unk> he observed <unk> <unk> gets their own ration of luck they say	1.7782794100389228
but leaving that for the moment how much did you part with he queried if i am not too <unk>	3.1742078140030117
—half a crown stephen responded	1.5083150518399293
i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere	1.913479130079546
mr bloom ejaculated <unk> not the least surprise at the intelligence i can quite credit the <unk> and i guarantee he invariably does	3.304377169002513
everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds	1.9514347275063075
but talking about things in general where added he with a smile will you sleep yourself	2.746375726325644
walking to sandycove is out of the question	2.430621225275475
and even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at westland row station	2.294833568748594
simply fag out there for nothing	1.7628728923678956
i don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the <unk> degree but why did you leave your father’s house	3.080796219439258
—to seek misfortune was stephen’s answer	1.5565638058819071
—i met your respected father on a recent occasion mr bloom <unk> returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on yesterday	2.4322954491058058
where does he live at present	1.810456328783109
i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved	3.0511494555149654
—i believe he is in dublin somewhere stephen answered <unk>	2.176387997698214
—a <unk> man mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior in more respects than one and a born <unk> if ever there was one	2.8935326555821463
he takes great pride quite legitimate out of you	1.7412737502777291
you could go back perhaps he <unk> still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two mulligan that is and that english tourist friend of his who eventually <unk> their third companion were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion which they did	1.6876124757881479
there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however such as it was stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in <unk> his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak <unk> shell cocoa that was in the <unk> kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the <unk> for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy boody and katey the cat meanwhile under the <unk> <unk> a mess of <unk> and <unk> fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third <unk> of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it being quarter tense or if not <unk> days or something like that	1.2689610031679222
—no mr bloom repeated again i wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who <unk> the humorous element dr mulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes	2.610157215682537
he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals	2.2592045402066545
of course you didn’t notice as much as i did	2.2943349204062953
but it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object	2.5799681533440912
he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a <unk> <unk> man by no means confined to medicine only who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was <unk> bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at <unk> or malahide was it	1.4556047973707602
was he was bound to admit an exceedingly <unk> deed which he could not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer <unk> or jealousy pure and simple	1.968419447286612
<unk> it simply <unk> to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains he ventured to throw out	3.213922643167379
grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet	2.394007738007462
adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably <unk> in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their <unk> language in a particularly animated way there being some little differences between the parties	2.192345972483447
— <unk> madonna che ci dia i <unk>	1.5838758229183805
<unk> la <unk> più	1.6239281446310554
mr bloom and stephen entered the cabman’s shelter an <unk> wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been before the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skin the goat fitzharris the invincible though he could not <unk> for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in	1.6265507027536246
a few moments later saw our two <unk> safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript <unk> of the genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking <unk> by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity	1.8329807108324359
—now touching a cup of coffee mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice it <unk> to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food say a roll of some description	2.543345761304649
accordingly his first act was with characteristic <unk> to order these commodities quietly	2.0753356944544104
the hoi polloi of jarvies or <unk> or whatever they were after a <unk> examination turned their eyes apparently <unk> away though one redbearded <unk> individual portion of whose hair was greyish a sailor probably still stared for some <unk> time before <unk> his rapt attention to the floor	2.023589647725157
mr bloom <unk> himself of the right of free speech he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in <unk> though to be sure rather in a quandary over voglio remarked to his <unk> in an audible tone of voice à propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious —a beautiful language	1.7782794100389228
i mean for singing purposes	1.4571356360767511
why do you not write your poetry in that language	2.5429048774063214
it is so melodious and full	1.872329450904432
stephen who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could suffering from <unk> generally replied —to fill the ear of a cow elephant	2.5524034588044717
they were <unk> over money	2.5220191805886296
of course he <unk> <unk> at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary it may be only the southern <unk> that <unk> it	3.046989570903508
the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête à tête put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed	2.4244620170823286
after which he beat a retreat to his counter mr bloom <unk> to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to	3.2913015060622643
for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by <unk> pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him	2.749783825520554
<unk> are <unk> stephen said after a pause of some little time like names	3.1111138791403583
cicero <unk> napoleon mr <unk>	1.3629908937788613
<unk> were as common as <unk>	1.4635227159419624
what’s in a name	1.0526249044873588
—yes to be sure mr bloom <unk> concurred	3.279179952183552
our name was changed too he added pushing the socalled roll across	2.0467800710078436
the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the <unk> <unk> stephen whom he had <unk> out for attention in particular <unk> by asking —and what might your name be	3.046989570903508
just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion’s boot but stephen apparently <unk> the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter answered —dedalus	2.364919447871442
the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy <unk> eyes rather bunged up from excessive use of boose preferably good old <unk> and water	2.672086614576002
—you know simon dedalus	1.1151026854850086
he asked at length	1.2294933238398027
<unk> heard of him stephen said	1.7187500390741965
mr bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too	2.998620407124045
—he’s irish the <unk> bold affirmed staring still in much the same way and nodding	2.507387661135939
—all too irish stephen rejoined	1.3895404585862359
as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark —i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder	1.8329807108324359
the <unk> dead shot	1.2285803813100389
though he was slightly <unk> by an occasional <unk> and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain	3.492142400039133
<unk> out there say	1.3857842307824324
eggs on the bottles	1.4138010700778265
cocks his gun over his shoulder	1.5415322949408483
he turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely	2.627445082130096
then he screwed his features up someway sideways and <unk> out into the night with an <unk> cast of countenance	3.0963178468731134
he then shouted once	1.218705942456054
the entire audience waited anticipating an additional <unk> there being still a further egg	2.151926718423547
egg two evidently demolished he nodded and winked adding <unk> <unk> bill shoots to kill never missed nor he never will	2.1192779228180987
a silence ensued till mr bloom for <unk> sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a <unk> competition like the <unk>	2.8713380629039267
—beg pardon the sailor said	1.4272454126283616
mr bloom pursued without flinching a <unk>	1.5399764462902763
—why the sailor replied relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond it might be a matter of ten years	2.7484746182872293
i seen him do that in stockholm	2.052979723158805

she’s my own true wife i haven’t seen for seven years now sailing about	2.0861829388137743
mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene the <unk> to the mariner’s roadside <unk> after having <unk> davy jones a rainy night with a blind moon	3.013327115850164

you little expected me but i’ve come to stay and make a fresh start	2.3136172231167946
there she sits a <unk> at the selfsame <unk>	2.798980978700174

i remain with much love your <unk> husband w	2.0092576650270417
the sailor who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident turned to one of the jarvies with the request —you don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare <unk> about you	2.848035868435802
the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand	2.627124310451618
—thank you the sailor said	1.5889323050058504
he deposited the quid in his gob and chewing and with some slow stammers proceeded —we come up this morning eleven o’clock	2.395401061498509
i <unk> to get over	2.566310661298236
paid off this afternoon	1.3032417322678305
in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very <unk> folded document	2.395784733382366
—you must have seen a fair share of the world the keeper remarked leaning on the counter	2.7461147968616966
—why the sailor answered upon reflection upon it i’ve <unk> a bit since i first joined on	2.4599930853336285
i was in the red sea	2.662253758306511
i was in china and north america and south america	2.7412625563477806
we was chased by <unk> one voyage	1.7975932992863015
i seen icebergs plenty <unk>	1.3486026326982343
i was in stockholm and the black sea the <unk> under captain dalton the best bloody man that ever <unk> a ship	3.3098270376119587
that’s how the russians prays	1.5958399532102219
—you seen queer sights don’t be talking put in a jarvey	2.2569506555450483
—why the sailor said shifting his partially chewed plug	2.197291691660629
i seen queer things too ups and downs	1.7628420708656602
i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid	2.233489536909181
he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and lodging it between his teeth bit ferociously <unk>	2.818478441912584
and i seen <unk> in <unk> that eats corpses and the livers of horses	3.0251634252193833

nobody <unk> a statement he winked saying <unk>	1.8098729577181565
mr bloom without <unk> surprise <unk> turned over the card to <unk> the partially obliterated address and <unk>	2.9105293421405953
it ran as follows <unk> postal señor a boudin <unk> <unk> <unk> chile	3.2038523445086753
there was no message evidently as he took particular notice	2.7797630493604464
though not an <unk> believer in the lurid story narrated or the <unk> <unk> for that matter despite william tell and the <unk> don <unk> de <unk> incident depicted in maritana on which occasion the <unk> ball passed through the <unk> hat having detected a <unk> between his name assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having <unk> the compass on the strict q	1.5947870582948211
somewhere and the <unk> addressee of the <unk> which made him <unk> some <unk> of our friend’s bona <unk> nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a <unk> plan he meant to one day <unk> some <unk> or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled <unk> to any great extent but he was at heart a born <unk> though by a trick of fate he had <unk> remained a <unk> except you call going to holyhead which was his longest martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but some deuced <unk> or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through	1.3367506999197079
but even suppose it did come to <unk> down the needful and breaking boyd’s heart it was not so dear purse <unk> a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to mullingar where he <unk> on going was five and six there and back	2.154434690031884
the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing <unk> and be in every way thoroughly <unk> especially for a chap whose liver was out of order seeing the different places along the route <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower abbey wealth of park lane to <unk> acquaintance with	1.566048452832833
another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and <unk> <unk> <unk> margate and so on beautiful <unk> the channel islands and similar <unk> spots which might prove highly <unk>	1.6265507027536246
not of course with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job witness mrs c p m’coy type lend me your valise and i’ll post you the ticket	2.476779883894137
no something top <unk> an all star irish caste the tweedy flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of <unk> to the elster grimes and moody manners perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of <unk> who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure	1.5947870582948211
that was the rub	2.667353947769347
also without being actually positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new <unk> to keep pace with the times apropos of the <unk> <unk> route which it was mooted was once more on the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> with the usual quantity of red tape and <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> generally	1.701254279852589
a great opportunity there certainly was for push and <unk> to meet the travelling needs of the public at large the average man ie brown robinson and co it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street when the system really needed <unk> up for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was <unk> from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever <unk> up since my old stick in the mud took me for a wife	1.3938972755249328
after all hang it they had their eleven and more <unk> months of it and <unk> a <unk> change of venue after the grind of city life in the <unk> for choice when dame nature is at her <unk> best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life	2.023589647725157
there were equally excellent opportunities for <unk> in the home island delightful <unk> spots for rejuvenation offering a <unk> of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque <unk> even poulaphouca to which there was a <unk> but also farther away from the <unk> crowd in wicklow <unk> <unk> the garden of ireland an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down and in the wilds of donegal where if report spoke true the coup <unk> was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily <unk> so that the <unk> of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic <unk> and otherwise silken thomas grace <unk> george <unk> rhododendrons several hundred feet above <unk> was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally usually by the way on their left leg it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar	1.1874815363065987
because of course <unk> tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired	2.6742235682200866
interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity pure and simple was whether it was the traffic that created the route or <unk> or the two sides in fact	2.848035868435802
he turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to stephen	2.799425830337655
—i seen a chinese one time related the doughty narrator that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different	2.7394849896657023

possibly perceiving an expression of <unk> on their faces the <unk> went on <unk> to his adventures	3.830148828822664
—and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap	2.2818746247349573
knife in his back	1.6550372239688425
whilst speaking he produced a <unk> <unk> quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position	3.425469630227466
—in a <unk> it was count of a <unk> between two <unk>	4.177385448751993
fellow hid behind a door come up behind him	2.108288529614191
prepare to meet your god says he	1.7975863270859014
it went into his back up to the butt	3.2142509965709154
—that’s a good bit of steel repeated he examining his formidable <unk>	2.109546026817848
after which <unk> dénouement sufficient to <unk> the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of <unk> otherwise pocket	2.6577236506845368
—they’re great for the cold steel somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all	2.9077900223104582
that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by <unk> on account of them using knives	3.091850985919059
at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss mr b	2.091662479651824
and stephen each in his own particular way both instinctively exchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly <unk> nous variety however towards where skin the goat alias the keeper not turning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his <unk> affair	2.154434690031884
his <unk> face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itself <unk> description conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on	2.704298565703654
there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause	1.4792768418292712
one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with the natives choza de another the <unk> discharge	2.2923170424191994
mr bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood	2.4617044383549254
he <unk> recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles when it took the <unk> world by storm <unk> speaking early in the <unk> eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteen	1.968419447286612
—ay boss the sailor broke in	1.5943467478567044
give us back them papers	1.4598438721412323
the request being <unk> with he <unk> them up with a scrape	2.79285347193289
—have you seen the rock of gibraltar	1.5417766344303259
the sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ay or no	2.4991312871880482
—ah you’ve touched there too mr bloom said europa point thinking he had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so simply letting <unk> a jet of <unk> into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn	1.9952623149688797
—what year would that be about	1.7272893372211853
can you recall the boats	1.4516956744699678
our soi disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering —i’m tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships	2.726061916815432
salt <unk> all the time	1.5808055279185549
tired seemingly he ceased	1.2293249887980302
his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a <unk> old <unk> fell to <unk> on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three <unk> of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves	1.6744824380115346
on more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite <unk> at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings	1.8529220216409523
and it left him wondering why	1.5779248409823723
possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up and down the <unk> and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under tempting the <unk>	2.761699813343848
and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all	2.307065851598403
nevertheless without going into the minutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of <unk> on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on <unk> the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter where living inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to them like that should <unk> its gratitude also to the <unk> and <unk> service who had to man the <unk> and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights kish and others liable to <unk> at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably <unk> not to say stormy weather	1.1835067295194688
—there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover the old <unk> himself a rover proceeded went <unk> and took up a soft job as gentleman’s <unk> at six quid a month	2.848035868435802
them are his trousers i’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that <unk>	2.7958899530643126
i hate roaming about	1.4589474410667649
there’s my son now danny run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in cork where he could be drawing easy money	2.5847693605181528
—what age is he	1.2166946512215475
queried one <unk> who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell the townclerk away from the <unk> cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of <unk> about the nasal <unk>	2.154434690031884
—why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son danny	2.4272844734676258
he’d be about eighteen now way i figure it	1.8762274955704061
the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image <unk> in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor	2.3713737056616555
—there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts	1.9912400112460646
i must get a wash tomorrow or next day	1.709080787436675
it’s them black lads i objects to	1.5565584632233587
i hate those <unk>	1.475763241275848
suck your blood dry they does	1.5049644304797831
seeing they were all looking at his chest he <unk> dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUMBER> and a young man’s sideface looking <unk> rather	2.1187853261287715
<unk> the <unk> explained	4.558139244728603
fellow the name of antonio done that	2.38781829465505
there he is himself a greek	2.7341408569176053
one asked the sailor	1.251958651504712
that worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round the	1.7548643346434147
—see here he said showing antonio	1.8375278605072378
there he is cursing the mate	2.32759165185918
and there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special <unk> evidently and he laughing at a <unk>	2.9072915172391998
and in point of fact the young man named <unk> livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the <unk> admiration of everybody including skin the goat who this time stretched over	2.513785968827729
—ay ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest he’s gone too	2.5637210970568414
ate by sharks after	1.1840837291032518
he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before	2.3165748378929614
<unk> bit of work one <unk> said	1.8519809326966066
—and what’s the number for	1.6625688531569869
loafer number two queried	1.3055832208566154
a third asked the sailor	1.3906130340735032
—ay ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number	2.720698732727425
a greek he was	1.2633891987104453
and then he added with rather <unk> humour considering his alleged end —as bad as old antonio for he left me on my ownio	2.401567327958765
the face of a <unk> glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably <unk> on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill	2.610157215682537
mr bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment <unk> but <unk> calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink	1.8529220216409523
his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay the partially <unk> female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you mrs b	1.968419447286612
and begged the chance of his washing	2.04684350697193
also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing	1.9031943343376458
still candour <unk> him to admit he had washed his wife’s <unk> when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with <unk> and draper’s <unk> ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt	1.9187520990478337
still just then being on <unk> he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off	2.6122666735587896
round the side of the evening telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented <unk> grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of <unk> round skipper murphy’s <unk> chest and then there was no more of her	1.8139306939110624
—the <unk> the keeper said	1.5144594476931763
—it beats me mr bloom confided to stephen medically i am speaking how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if he values his health in the least unfortunate creature	2.023589647725157
of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition	2.355005735976201
still no matter what the cause is from	2.1517443512423755
stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking —in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade	2.3776795803203603
fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul	2.3276237666984496
she is a bad merchant	1.9343686102808064
she buys dear and sells cheap	1.5932522373083053
the elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a <unk> said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to <unk> to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any <unk> <unk> on the subject a necessary evil were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a <unk> was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start	1.5160826983319609
whoever <unk> on a policy of the sort he said and <unk> the matter thoroughly would <unk> a <unk> boon on everybody concerned	4.183820337998528
—you as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul	2.391902944702449
or do you mean the intelligence the <unk> as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup	3.1379712831625546
i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter	2.6058726660939184
otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays for instance	2.1299776586984613
thus cornered stephen had to make a <unk> effort of memory to try and <unk> and remember before he could say —they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible	2.610157215682537
it would be immortal i understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who from all i can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes corruptio per se and corruptio per <unk> both being excluded by court etiquette	1.9952623149688797
mr bloom thoroughly <unk> in the general gist of this though the mystical <unk> involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a <unk> on the head of simple promptly <unk> <unk>	2.4244620170823286
i shouldn’t think that is the proper word	2.5238182642167093
of course i grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon	2.427308855869928
but what i am <unk> to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like <unk> though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man i mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a <unk> natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god	1.5753186734235158
—o that stephen <unk> has been proved conclusively by several of the <unk> passages in holy writ apart from circumstantial evidence	2.8185032249435076
on this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages <unk>	2.4725258134342147
the more experienced of the two <unk> sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief	2.7738637969527353
i’m not so sure about that	1.5070090688462965
that’s a matter for <unk> opinion and without dragging in the <unk> side of the business i beg to <unk> with you in <unk> there	3.9810717055349727
my belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine <unk> all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like hamlet and bacon as you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i of course i needn’t tell you	1.79571449437164
can’t you drink that coffee by the way	1.740314689232664
let me stir it	1.208940255230719
it’s like one of our <unk> bricks disguised	2.2772385477224715
still no one can give what he hasn’t got	2.1975234453726973
<unk> stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further	2.6276576856164713
<unk> being a <unk> bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching <unk> on the coffee palace and its temperance and <unk> work	2.543345761304649
to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good <unk> such as the present one they were in run on <unk> lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful <unk> admittance free by <unk> men for the lower orders	1.9952623149688797
on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest <unk> indeed for her <unk>	2.610157215682537
the idea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak of	2.41500768806268
anyhow inspection medical inspection of all <unk> seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr <unk> <unk> cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved	2.662779432547427
—have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being <unk>	2.562367177319834
thus <unk> on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown <unk> it <unk> out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the <unk> beverage	2.610157215682537
—still it’s solid food his good genius urged i’m a <unk> for solid food his one and only reason being not <unk> in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manual	2.2758459260747883
you ought to eat more solid food	2.0920721038754513
you would feel a different man	1.7836246163271856
<unk> i can eat stephen said	1.8424113228106878
but o oblige me by taking away that knife	1.9321610557914184
i can’t look at the point of it	2.625883410889122
it reminds me of roman history	1.9139247740312415
mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the <unk> article a blunt <unk> ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it	2.4244620170823286
—our mutual friend’s stories are like himself mr bloom apropos of knives remarked to his <unk> <unk> voce	2.5455578736134243
do you think they are genuine	2.574762438336982
he could spin those <unk> for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots	2.305264231487131
yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the <unk> he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel	1.701254279852589
he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and <unk> him up ever since he clapped eyes on him	3.4004209488131205
though a <unk> man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to <unk> there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to <unk> such a <unk> specimen with the <unk> and <unk> fraternity	2.023589647725157
he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in <unk> vile to say nothing of the antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who <unk> his crimes in the <unk> manner above described	1.5848931924611136
—mind you i’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention he resumed	2.2741321729038995
<unk> scenes are occasionally if not often met with	1.9003627363159552
giants though that is rather a far cry you see once in a way <unk> the <unk> queen	3.2320114310075163
in those <unk> in henry street i myself saw some <unk> as they are called sitting <unk> they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee were utterly <unk> from sitting that way so long cramped up being adored as gods	1.6378937069540642
there’s an example again of simple souls	1.7887208612534733
however reverting to friend sinbad and his <unk> adventures who reminded him a bit of ludwig alias <unk> when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was <unk> with the <unk> in the flying dutchman a <unk> success and his host of admirers came in large numbers everyone simply <unk> to hear him though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing <unk> <unk> about it he <unk>	1.4942339672143998
on the contrary that <unk> in the back touch was quite in keeping with those <unk> though candidly he was none the less free to admit those <unk> and <unk> in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober <unk> hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to <unk> the harmless necessary animal of the <unk> persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent <unk> with garlic de <unk> off him or her next day on the quiet and he added on the cheap	1.3894954943731377
<unk> for instance he continued passionate temperaments like that impetuous as old nick are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your <unk> doublequick with those <unk> they carry in the abdomen	2.543345761304649
it comes from the great heat climate generally	1.8931878096871546
my wife is so to speak spanish half that is	2.3052318660317295
point of fact she could actually claim spanish <unk> if she wanted having been born in technically spain ie gibraltar	2.6239734530885985
she has the spanish type	1.6849216342866298
quite dark regular <unk> black	1.4271306402338635
i for one certainly believe climate accounts for character	1.7929815549765922
that’s why i asked you if you wrote your poetry in italian	2.5163065502168305
—the temperaments at the door stephen <unk> with were very passionate about ten shillings	2.6788387741646034
<unk> <unk> <unk> sua	6.462394328239541
—quite so mr bloom <unk>	1.483183184980675
—then stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere we have the impetuosity of dante and the <unk> triangle miss <unk> he fell in love with and <unk> and san <unk> <unk>	2.543345761304649
—it’s in the blood mr bloom acceded at once	2.560180250253971
all are washed in the blood of the sun	1.562969146308021
coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare street museum today shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it and i was just looking at those antique statues there	2.795386793145454
the splendid proportions of hips bosom	1.468919072127583
you simply don’t knock against those kind of women here	1.8415231091005717
an exception here and there	1.2683611226694715
handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what i’m talking about is the female form	2.7256318705543046
besides they have so little taste in dress most of them which greatly <unk> a woman’s natural beauty no matter what you say	2.602145923335464
rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a <unk> of mine but still it’s a thing i simply hate to see	3.379396429985922
interest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog <unk> with icebergs all that sort of thing	2.558552715387154
<unk> of course had his own say to say	2.701380984249806
he had doubled the cape a few odd times and <unk> a <unk> a kind of wind in the china seas and through all those <unk> of the deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to that effect a pious medal he had that saved him	1.968419447286612
that was the talk of the town that year albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the irish times <unk> running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror	2.154434690031884
lady cairns of <unk> run into by the mona which was on an opposite tack in rather <unk> weather and lost with all hands on deck	2.5029186651931337
no aid was given	1.2283124110110535
her master the mona ’s said he was afraid his collision <unk> would give way	2.49882598197469
she had no water it appears in her hold	2.2572548728413016
at this stage an incident happened	1.4874865268605464
it having become necessary for him to <unk> a reef the sailor vacated his seat	3.3157092175340726
—let me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze	2.692490591757323
while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two <unk> of presumably <unk> rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior saw him produce a bottle and <unk> it or <unk> and <unk> its nozzle to his lips take a good old <unk> swig out of it with a gurgling noise	1.6265507027536246

while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire ours or his and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it	2.355647430367244
then they began to have a few <unk> words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in <unk> and come to blows	2.321954250288982
from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to <unk> the suggestion as <unk> <unk> for <unk> that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for he was fully <unk> of the fact that their neighbours across the channel unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealed their strength than the opposite	1.701254279852589
it was quite on a par with the <unk> idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies equally <unk> to the issue might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart	1.474142020110622
so the scene between the pair of them the <unk> of the place <unk> to be or have been fitzharris the famous invincible and the other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the <unk> a student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the game	1.715437896342879
and as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasn’t the other person at all he b	2.6070189867121973
couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the <unk> unless you were a <unk> idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their <unk> there always being the <unk> of a <unk> coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like denis or peter carey an idea he utterly repudiated	1.6496480740980204
quite apart from that he disliked those careers of <unk> and crime on principle	3.073842632752276
in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend the <unk> skin the etcetera he had <unk> outlived his welcome	3.17043154163845
he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high	2.454249664563004

generous to a fault of course <unk> no <unk> or any idea of the sort always <unk> at the bone for the shadow	3.4126990066690124
so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some £	2.5849290910179943
then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually <unk> the <unk>	3.0392977325973205

he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of <unk> dark pride at the soft <unk> with a glance also of <unk> for he seemed to <unk> in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly	2.3713737056616555

observed or rather his voice speaking did all must work have to together	2.195123347547027

you both belong to ireland the brain and the brawn	1.969309465591502
each is equally important	1.21583420429086
—you suspect stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that i may be important because i belong to the <unk> saint patrice called ireland for short	2.916417971045435
—i would go a step farther mr bloom <unk>	2.019847247432918
—but i suspect stephen interrupted that ireland must be important because it belongs to me	1.9790040819868149
—what belongs queried mr bloom bending <unk> he was perhaps under some misapprehension	2.5251274272193047
unfortunately i didn’t catch the latter portion	1.9467329191130656
what was it you	2.1016997852033525
stephen patently <unk> repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding —we can’t change the country	2.141163035276579
let us change the subject	1.2985564852661633
at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom to change the subject looked down but in a quandary as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry	2.560750214733368
the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part	2.3784629093533214
needless to say the fumes of his recent <unk> spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state	2.5810605657974612
probably the <unk> to which mr b attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people	3.014305841478018
with a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he <unk> <unk> with an air of some <unk> remembering he had just come back from paris the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light on the subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so <unk> nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves	1.5947870582948211
for instance there was the case of o’callaghan for one the <unk> <unk> respectably connected though of inadequate means with his mad <unk> among whose other gay <unk> when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact	1.8529220216409523
and then the usual dénouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be <unk> away by a few friends after a strong hint to a blind horse from john <unk> of lower castle yard so as not to be made <unk> under section two of the criminal law <unk> act certain names of those <unk> being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains	1.5085907086001784
briefly putting two and two together six sixteen which he <unk> turned a deaf ear to antonio and so forth jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the <unk> or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne then heir apparent the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state he reflected about the errors of <unk> and crowned heads running counter to <unk> such as the <unk> case a number of years before under their <unk> in a way scarcely intended by nature a thing good mrs <unk> as the law stands was <unk> down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always <unk> more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it	1.2376350284724815

highly <unk> of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and even supposing he thought a return highly <unk> all things considered	2.8510607251463234
something evidently riled them in his death	1.896164295109185
either he <unk> out too tamely of acute <unk> just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were <unk> to find the job was taken out of their hands	1.4806572771858608
of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the alice where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several <unk> such as fox and stewart so the remark which <unk> from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility	1.79571449437164
naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet whereas messrs so and so who though they weren’t even a patch on the former man <unk> the roost after their <unk> features were very few and far between	1.6876124757881479

first it was strictly platonic till nature <unk> and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a <unk> and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few <unk> however who were resolved upon <unk> his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the <unk> extent that it subsequently <unk> into	1.5753186734235158

why as he reflected irishtown strand a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since as it happened he went to <unk> on the north side	2.761699813343848

stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large <unk> lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of <unk> in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom with more than vision of breasts her full lips parted and some perfect teeth standing near ostensibly with gravity a piano on the rest of which was in old madrid a ballad pretty in its way which was then all the vogue	1.4677992676220695
her the lady’s eyes dark large looked at stephen about to smile about something to be admired lafayette of westmoreland street dublin’s <unk> photographic artist being responsible for the esthetic execution	2.3818850465793777

very like her then	1.3804407626462154
beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who he intimated was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age <unk> proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen	1.8957356524063758
as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup	2.2758459260747883
she could without difficulty he said have <unk> for the <unk> not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the	3.046661681506045
he dwelt being a bit of an artist in his spare time on the female form in general <unk> because as it so happened no later than that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues perfectly developed as works of art in the national museum	2.154434690031884
marble could give the original shoulders back all the symmetry all the rest yes <unk> it does though saint joseph’s sovereign <unk> alors <unk>	2.523795132211869
whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word	2.179721756861565
the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack <unk> good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself her stage presence being frankly a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to	1.7301957388458942
but it was scarcely professional etiquette so	2.343558388846027
though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm	2.8286344471185156
and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion	2.82289676356702
nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint	2.263031158493788
suppose she was gone when he	1.911345670018646
i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning <unk> bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses <unk> in it which must have fell down sufficiently <unk> beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to <unk> murray	1.79571449437164
the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished educated <unk> and <unk> into the bargain far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would	2.610157215682537
besides he said the picture was handsome which say what you like it was though at the moment she was distinctly <unk>	2.8192972376968877
an awful lot of <unk> went on about that sort of thing involving a <unk> <unk> with the usual splash page of <unk> about the same old matrimonial tangle <unk> misconduct with professional <unk> or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and <unk> about the whole business	2.023589647725157
how they were <unk> to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and <unk> expressions leaving no <unk> to show that they openly <unk> two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course intimate	1.6265507027536246
then the decree nisi and the king’s <unk> tries to show cause why and he failing to <unk> it nisi was made absolute	2.5540983087740057
but as for that the two <unk> wrapped up as they largely were in one another could safely afford to <unk> it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party <unk> in due course	2.023589647725157
he b enjoyed the distinction of being close to erin’s <unk> king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic <unk> when the fallen leader’s who <unk> stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery leader’s trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the <unk> works of the insuppressible or no it was united ireland a by no means by the by appropriate <unk> and broke up the <unk> with <unk> or something like that all on account of some <unk> effusions from the <unk> pens of the <unk> <unk> at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals	1.324192791886045
though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the <unk> till they discovered to their vast <unk> that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a <unk> which she however was the first to perceive	1.79571449437164
as those were particularly hot times in the general <unk> bloom sustained a minor <unk> from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course <unk> lodging some place about the pit of the stomach fortunately not of a grave character	2.154434690031884
his hat <unk> a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and as a matter of strict history bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost <unk> who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else what’s bred in the bone <unk> into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect <unk> saying thank you sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day history repeating itself with a difference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave	1.1835067295194688
on the other hand what <unk> him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing <unk> pretending to understand everything the why and the wherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging <unk> of her lord and master upon her knees and <unk> to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the <unk> husband would <unk> the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others	1.2141425040375704
he personally being of a <unk> bias believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when <unk> her duties she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent the <unk> being that her affections <unk> on another the cause of many <unk> between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famous cases of feminine <unk> proved up to the hilt	1.301678755323262
in the nature of single <unk> he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a <unk> sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson who was very possibly the particular <unk> who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction <unk> in the boy and girl <unk> idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names <unk> or <unk> with the orthodox preliminary canter of <unk> and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and <unk>	1.324192791886045
to think of him house and <unk> <unk> by some landlady worse than any <unk> was really too bad at his age	3.8013511095395094
the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something <unk> he certainly ought to eat even were it only an <unk> made on <unk> maternal nutriment or failing that the homely <unk> <unk> boiled	1.9952623149688797
—at what o’clock did you <unk>	1.5628498938589666
he questioned of the slim form and tired though <unk> face	2.0320604928013584
—some time yesterday stephen said	1.3213189979986357
exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow friday	2.1417864300199896
ah you mean it’s after twelve	1.7066777500695953
literally <unk> at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected	2.212337016886884
though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the one train of thought	2.622837737393355
at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a <unk> <unk> to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in <unk> which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a <unk> regard for those same ultra ideas	1.9429496147158305
for instance when the evicted tenants question then at its first <unk> <unk> largely in people’s mind though it goes without saying not <unk> a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its <unk> some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as <unk> the <unk> of modern opinion a partiality however which <unk> his mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was <unk> with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time <unk> as a <unk> which was one reason he strongly <unk> the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the <unk> in barney kiernan’s so that he though often considerably misunderstood and the least <unk> of mortals be it repeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from <unk> and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it <unk> as a <unk> conclusion on fine young fellows chiefly destruction of the fittest in a word	1.181581732618101
anyhow upon weighing up the <unk> and <unk> getting on for one as it was it was high time to be retiring for the night	3.639869376859297
on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives	2.942727176209282
everything pointed to the fact that it <unk> him to <unk> himself to the full of the opportunity all things considered	3.4855143712246246
his initial impression was he was a shade <unk> or not over effusive but it grew on him someway	2.8472402894528854
for one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly <unk> him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he did entertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe if found suitable	1.6744824380115346
at all events he wound up by concluding <unk> for the nonce <unk> precedent a cup of epps’s cocoa and a <unk> for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a <unk> he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the <unk> no rumpus of any sort was kicked up	1.539926526059492
a move had to be made because that merry old soul the <unk> in question who appeared to be glued to the spot didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some <unk> bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that <unk> <unk> whereabouts for a few days to come alternately <unk> their feelings the <unk> with <unk> revolver <unk> <unk> on the tropical calculated to freeze the <unk> of anybody’s bones and mauling their <unk> charms <unk> with rough and tumble gusto to the <unk> of large <unk> of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address as mr algebra remarks <unk>	1.2731955290816555
at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle <unk> to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew	2.9374958703954985
people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep	2.4098440920775808
the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles	1.6541495909361288
your god was a jew	1.1205295579773562
because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from <unk> on shannon or <unk> in the county sligo	3.6053024215232146
—i propose our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over	2.411068774970757
my <unk> are quite close in the vicinity	2.0722474764003156
you can’t drink that stuff	1.4501325777170073
do you like cocoa	1.8236480131797115
the best plan clearly being to clear out the remainder being plain sailing he beckoned while prudently pocketing the photo to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to	2.2175714836165845
—yes that’s the best he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less	2.5070286614794997
all kinds of <unk> plans were flashing through his <unk> busy brain education the genuine article literature journalism prize titbits up to date <unk> concert tours in english watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres turning money away duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck	1.5753186734235158
an opening was all was wanted	1.7511445269227077
because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well by the way no harm to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to	1.9952623149688797
the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy earl <unk> had presided at the <unk> association dinner in london somewhere	3.433320018281994
silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling <unk>	1.960562111335352
then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir <unk> <unk> had left <unk> for the chief <unk> lodge or words to that effect	2.6826957952797255
to which <unk> piece of intelligence echo answered why	2.0994472828886233
—give us a squint at that literature grandfather the ancient mariner put in <unk> some natural impatience	2.3190868042311936

the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried	1.714770911140936

hereupon he pawed the journal open and <unk> upon lord only knows what found drowned or the <unk> of king willow <unk> having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for <unk> during which time completely regardless of <unk> the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which <unk> pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions that is to say either simply looking on <unk> or passing a trivial remark	1.4330125702369627
to cut a long story short bloom grasping the situation was the first to rise from his seat so as not to <unk> their welcome having first and foremost being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming making a grand total of fourpence the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers literally the last of the mohicans he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures coffee d <unk> do and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way as wetherup used to remark	1.2891222895981396
—come he counselled to close the <unk>	1.6481539987995972
seeing that the <unk> worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente	2.4244620170823286
stephen who confessed to still feeling <unk> and fagged out paused at the for a moment the door	2.360583412885813
—one thing i never understood he said to be original on the spur of the moment	2.7134312000347043
why they put tables upside down at night i mean chairs upside down on the tables in <unk>	2.5835410636481835
to which impromptu the <unk> bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation saying straight off —to sweep the floor in the morning	2.356194248331854
so saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right a habit of his by the bye his right side being in classical <unk> his tender achilles	2.610157215682537
the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins	2.6478834661900237
—it will the air do you good bloom said meaning also the walk in a moment	2.4639761319051336
accordingly he passed his left arm in stephen’s right and led him on accordingly	2.5242596468831424
—yes stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him <unk> and wobbly and all that	2.8031334422554024
anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones brazier etc where the municipal supernumerary ex gumley was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy as the adage has it dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new	2.304189244811255
and apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a <unk> to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd <unk> that <unk> at the time of the split and chiefly the <unk> peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their <unk>	1.8329807108324359
so they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for which bloom as a pure <unk> possessed the greatest love as they made tracks arm in arm across beresford place	2.563079701093819
<unk> music though <unk> grand in its way was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first go off but the music of <unk> huguenots <unk> seven last words on the cross and mozart’s twelfth mass he simply <unk> in the gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat	1.6496480740980204
he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and <unk> <unk> or bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be	2.3713737056616555
he also yielded to none in his admiration of <unk> stabat mater a work simply <unk> in immortal numbers in which his wife madam marion tweedy made a hit a veritable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other <unk> and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit <unk> church in upper gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with <unk> or <unk> rather	1.5848931924611136
there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally <unk> desire for an encore	2.4244620170823286
on the whole though <unk> preferably light opera of the don giovanni description and martha a gem in its line he had a <unk> though with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn	2.4816289228368253
and talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old <unk> he mentioned par excellence lionel’s air in martha m’appari which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be more accurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips of stephen’s respected father sung to perfection a study of the number in fact which made all the others take a back seat	1.6496480740980204
stephen in reply to a politely put query said he didn’t sing it but launched out into <unk> of shakespeare’s songs at least of in or about that period the <unk> <unk> who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist who anno <unk> <unk> <unk> an instrument he was contemplating <unk> from mr <unk> <unk> whom b	1.8139306939110624
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and <unk> and son with their <unk> and comes <unk> and <unk> william who played the virginals he said in the queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one <unk> who made toys or airs and john bull	1.9187520990478337
on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the <unk> a horse dragging a sweeper <unk> on the <unk> ground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull	1.9187520990478337
he inquired if it was john bull the political <unk> of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as a striking coincidence	3.1190033058294637
by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceiving bloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other’s sleeve gently jocosely remarking —our lives are in peril tonight	2.333598215759919
beware of the <unk>	1.0983762490218272
bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new a different <unk> of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts	1.6496480740980204
but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but as he <unk> reflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up	2.862883802093121
he was just a big nervous foolish <unk> kind of a horse without a second care in the world	3.023636113284568
but it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel ship of the <unk> <unk> grapes into potheen in his hump	3.433320018281994
nine <unk> of them all could be <unk> or trained nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees	2.8652202204521595
whale with a <unk> hairpin alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster <unk> my eagle eye	2.9919897698515925
these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat <unk> from stephen’s words while the ship of the street was <unk> and stephen went on about the highly interesting old	2.761699813343848
—what’s this i was saying	1.6268119894091468
my wife he intimated plunging in <unk> res would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind	2.5212863554901053
he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen image of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an <unk> <unk> after as he was perhaps not that way built	2.232735148777284
still supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected it opened up new <unk> in his mind such as lady <unk> irish industries concert on the preceding monday and aristocracy in general	2.6826957952797255
exquisite variations he was now describing on an air youth here has end by <unk> <unk> <unk> a dutchman of amsterdam where the <unk> come from	3.279913751945049
even more he liked an old german song of johannes <unk> about the clear sea and the voices of sirens sweet murderers of men which <unk> bloom a bit von <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> die <unk> <unk>	2.543345761304649
these opening bars he sang and translated <unk>	1.7614666346900898
bloom nodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did	2.5308014231513853
a <unk> beautiful tenor voice like that the <unk> of <unk> which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as <unk> and being able to read music into the bargain command its own price where <unk> were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an <unk> into fashionable houses in the best <unk> quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and <unk> people where with his university degree of b	1.4384498882876628
a huge ad in its way and <unk> bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would <unk> score a distinct success being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other <unk> if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better <unk> his way into their good graces as he a youthful <unk> in society’s <unk> <unk> hardly understood how a little thing like that could <unk> against you	1.5483652565854986
it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him <unk> in their musical and artistic <unk> during the <unk> of the christmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the <unk> of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of which as he happened to know were on <unk> fact without giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he cared to could easily have	1.5160826983319609
added to which of course would be the <unk> emolument by no means to be sneezed at going hand in hand with his <unk> fees	3.426527458035861
not he <unk> that for the sake of filthy <unk> he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time	2.567525676386895
but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both <unk> and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a <unk> moment when every little helped	2.053525026457146
besides though taste <unk> had <unk> to a degree original music like that different from the <unk> rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublin’s musical world after the usual <unk> run of <unk> tenor <unk> <unk> on a confiding public by <unk> st <unk> and <unk> st just and their genus <unk>	1.7615770326037883
yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the <unk> esteem where he could command a stiff figure and <unk> ahead give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house given a <unk> if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs so to speak a big if however with some <unk> of the goahead sort to <unk> the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much <unk> prince of good fellows	1.4077153669117268
and it need not <unk> from the other by one <unk> as being his own master he would have heaps of time to <unk> literature in his spare moments when <unk> of so doing without its <unk> with his vocal career or containing anything <unk> whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone	1.8957356524063758
in fact he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at all	2.543345761304649
the horse was just then	1.5349631336646548
and later on at a propitious opportunity he <unk> bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to <unk> and even to a slight extent with some hilarious <unk> when not present <unk> him or whatever you like to call it which in bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty <unk> on that side of a person’s character no pun intended	1.5013107289081733
the horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak halted and rearing high a proud <unk> tail added his <unk> by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smoking globes of <unk>	2.232735148777284

<unk> <NUMBER> yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the city arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old <unk> mrs riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest <unk> ever was actually afraid to lay out d for her <unk> spirit telling me all her <unk> she had too much old chat in her about politics and <unk> and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the world if all the women were her sort down on <unk> and <unk> of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her <unk> talk about mr riordan here and mr riordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like that in him polite to old women like that and <unk> and <unk> too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to <unk> it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes because theyre so weak and <unk> when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose <unk> youd think it was o tragic and that <unk> one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress miss <unk> bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate <unk> and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor <unk> his corns afraid hed get <unk> but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big <unk> i saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at <unk> <unk> and turned my back on him when he <unk> out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big <unk> i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him <unk> death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary we had in ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUMBER> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <NUMBER> per <unk> going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and <unk> like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there <unk> another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im <unk> out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id <unk> him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him <unk> him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that <unk> drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the <unk> yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost <unk> you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the <unk> in his <unk> i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be embraced by one in his <unk> and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some <unk> id like to sip those <unk> green and yellow expensive drinks those <unk> <unk> drink with the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the <unk> talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful <unk> in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that evening in <unk> street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed <unk> if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and <unk> and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had to <unk> my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina <unk> husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called <unk> or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it <unk> the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like <unk> or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if <unk> do him any good i know they were <unk> a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina <unk> housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not <unk> to see her a <unk> that was why we had the <unk> row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was <unk> with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first <unk> he said he was he annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of <unk> things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of <unk> poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUMBER> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a <unk> to her with his <unk> kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course <unk> me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the <unk> i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it <unk> her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt <unk> the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUMBER> for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die <NUMBER> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs <unk> that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the <unk> villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off <unk> wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have

and i were out with him at the open air <unk> that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw

slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i <unk> and

quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUMBER> big poppies because mine was the th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at <unk> barn i couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well

wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the <unk> concert at <unk> <unk> boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the

till he finished it the two gentlemen in the rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take a st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well o i suppose <unk> be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an <unk> man that common <unk> that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> <unk> perhaps then you have to look out of the

lord roberts when i had the map of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the stabat mater by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man <unk> is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after the war that <unk> and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner <unk> <unk> g th <unk> nd east <unk> <unk> of <unk> fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old <unk> paul and the rest of the other old <unk> go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even <unk> shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la <unk> it was lovely after looking across the bay from algeciras all the lights of the rock like <unk> or those sham battles on the <NUMBER> acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the march past the th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won <unk> his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a <unk> like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and <unk> themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit <unk> of course when i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides <unk> down on me like that all the time with his big <unk> hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his <unk> cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUMBER> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of <unk> tip cursing him to the lowest <unk> that <unk> he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long <unk> over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at <unk> when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and <unk> and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and <unk> were <unk> silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good <unk> for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her <unk> she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of <unk> stockings is <unk> after one days wear i could have brought them back to <unk> this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those <unk> corsets id want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUMBER> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from <unk> was as flat as a <unk> he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of <unk> he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that <unk> any good might <unk> it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or <unk> with some of that opoponax and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot <unk> and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUMBER> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and <unk> up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUMBER> years more i have of life up to <NUMBER> no im what am i at all ill be <NUMBER> in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her <unk> on the <unk> she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty <unk> in <unk> street st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs <unk> the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUMBER> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master <unk> somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her <unk> fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her <unk> as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old <unk> face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page <NUMBER> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers <unk> about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for <unk> when he could have been in mr cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him <unk> there to be the manager he gave me a great <unk> once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old <unk> dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to <unk> and burns as i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking <unk> everything he can <unk> off the shelves into it if i went by his <unk> every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a <unk> standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the <unk> one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were yes i think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty <unk> he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs beaten up with <unk> <unk> them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUMBER> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a <unk> that disgusting cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his <unk> up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the <unk> relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the mens greenhouse near the harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUMBER> of the <NUMBER> wonders of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the <unk> party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery i went into <NUMBER> of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that <NUMBER> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the camerons werent there to see me <unk> in the mens place <unk> i tried to draw a picture of it before i tore it up like a sausage or something i wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said i could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the job in helys and i was selling the clothes and <unk> in the coffee palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the <unk> he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <NUMBER> with the citrons penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the towel to my face that was his <unk> hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor brady to give me the belladonna <unk> i had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if i only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the nd time tickling me behind with his finger i was coming for about <NUMBER> minutes with my legs round him i had to hug him after o lord i wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute thursday friday one saturday two sunday three o lord i cant wait till monday <unk> train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling

poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to <unk> academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he <unk> and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the <unk> all day put her in a <unk> with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little <unk> statue with her <unk> and <unk> before she left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUMBER> shillings wouldnt even <unk> the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me whistling with those <unk> of murray girls calling for her can milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the <unk> and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i <unk> on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last <unk> too split in <NUMBER> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle <unk> and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great <unk> too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to <unk> up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for <unk> tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any trilby or her <unk> every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit <unk> i think i saw him after trying to get near two <unk> ladies outside <unk> window at the same little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly till i was what <NUMBER> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that <unk> connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with <unk> though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a <unk> of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at <NUMBER> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a <unk> when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with <unk> the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her <NUMBER> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that <unk> of course <unk> i was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i

last time she turned on the <unk> i was just like that myself they <unk> order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us <unk> here instead of getting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old mrs fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job i found that rotten old <unk> <unk> that got lost behind the dresser i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially simon dedalus son his father such a <unk> with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us i wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody <unk> him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head i ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the <unk> mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat i told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats

auction isnt it simply <unk> that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that michael gunn gave him to see mrs kendal and her husband at the gaiety something he did about insurance for him in drimmies i was fit to be tied though i wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about spinoza and his soul thats dead i suppose millions of years ago i smiled the best i could all in a swamp leaning forward as if i was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag i wont forget that wife of <unk> in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted i suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it i wish he had what i had then hed <unk> i bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what o patience above its pouring out of me like

better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a <unk> easy god i wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman o lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy o how the waters come down at <unk> who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have i something growing in me getting that

guinea please and asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything <unk>

the night he borrowed the <unk> to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a <unk> childs <unk> didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his <unk> and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn <unk> he was always on for <unk> too when i sang maritana with him at freddy <unk> private opera he had a delicious glorious voice <unk> dearest goodbye sweetheart sweet heart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm <unk> o maritana <unk> flower we sang <unk> though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present

he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the th card after that the <NUMBER> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUMBER> queens and the <NUMBER> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUMBER> red s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting

i wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUMBER> i was married <NUMBER> milly is <NUMBER> yesterday <NUMBER> what age was he then at dillons <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> about <NUMBER> i suppose hes <NUMBER> or more im not too old for him if hes <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> i hope hes not that <unk> university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking <unk> cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the <unk> from <unk> the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy <unk> ad and <unk> ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand <unk> from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too in <NUMBER> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like <unk> or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of washing it from <NUMBER> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the st thing in the morning till i see if the <unk> comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half <unk> under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUMBER> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the <unk> that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that <unk> way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old <unk> in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those <unk> saying passing the <unk> of <unk> lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt <unk> hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be <unk> me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes <unk> anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even <unk> a nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUMBER> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUMBER> lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a <unk> nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUMBER> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where <unk> know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those <unk> <unk> in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our

me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of <unk> listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great <unk> don <unk> de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUMBER> s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be <unk> around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and <unk> when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual <unk> house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that <unk> me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little <unk> jacket i <unk> crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the <unk> about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of <unk> around the city meeting god knows who <unk> and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to <unk> none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so <unk> im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUMBER> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar <unk> <unk> they had the devils queer names there father <unk> of santa maria that gave me the rosary <unk> y <unk> in the calle las <unk> <unk> and <unk> and mrs <unk> in governor street o what a name id go and

all upside down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the <unk> and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in <unk> i could do the <unk> the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos <unk> <unk> <unk> lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUMBER> he can make it for <NUMBER> im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a <unk> of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that i badly want or a <unk> dressing jacket like the one long ago in <unk> only <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> ill just give him one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of <unk> old bed in any case i might go over to the

know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> times <unk> theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him stand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUMBER> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want £ <NUMBER> or perhaps ill tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to <unk> it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt <unk> all my good drawers o i suppose that cant be helped ill do the indifferent <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> questions ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back i know every turn in him ill <unk> my bottom well and let out a few smutty words <unk> or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then ill suggest about yes o wait now sonny my turn is coming ill be quite gay and friendly over it o but

fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the <unk> <unk> and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no god i wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something i often asked him <unk> or whatever they call themselves go and wash the <unk> off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes i know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do i so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day i got

flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why i liked him because i saw he understood or felt what a woman is and i knew i could always get round him and i gave him all the pleasure i could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and i wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky i was thinking of so many things he didnt know of mulvey and mr stanhope and hester and father and old captain groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the <unk> house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the greeks and the jews and the <unk> and the devil knows who else from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market all <unk> outside <unk> <unk> and the poor <unk> slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the <unk> of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome moors all in white and <unk> like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and <unk> with the old windows of the <unk> <NUMBER> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the <unk> half open at night and the <unk> and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and o that awful <unk> torrent

and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes	1.0026801798522547
