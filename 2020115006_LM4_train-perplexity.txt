a yellow <unk> ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air	1.54735381189551
he held the bowl aloft and <unk> — introibo ad altare dei	1.4886735734675813
halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out <unk> —come up kinch	1.4110669667261528
come up you fearful jesuit	1.1783153513729425
solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains	1.4820249613965952
then <unk> sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head	1.7647916736129785
stephen dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light <unk> hair <unk> and <unk> like pale oak	1.9927944427446838
buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly	1.4043275520781762
he added in a <unk> tone —for this o dearly beloved is the genuine <unk> body and soul and blood and ouns	1.7446112720106348
shut your eyes gents	1.3557641937428646
a little trouble about those white <unk>	1.224053141424953
he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points	1.5608610932503615
two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm	1.216862565402719
—thanks old chap he cried briskly	1.3086149663843294
that will do nicely	1.1699043852939477
he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown	1.4583352308320376
the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages	1.445323636829115
a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips	1.2458947735893633
—the mockery of it	1.0209445379011353
your absurd name an ancient greek	1.2079862014418163
he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself	1.6552925739135305
stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck	1.6330912860303333
buck mulligan’s gay voice went on	1.1440202559062072
—my name is absurd too malachi mulligan two <unk>	1.2729795309615903
but it has a hellenic ring hasn’t it	1.2751189994605214
tripping and sunny like the buck himself	1.2659092698611847
we must go to <unk>	1.2421441249964265
will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid	1.619268752788883
he laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried —will he come	1.5274016916342414
ceasing he began to shave with care	1.5909668419239333
—tell me mulligan stephen said quietly	1.2193484622703339
—how long is haines going to stay in this tower	1.3470616522147674
buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder	1.313403850497257
—god isn’t he dreadful	1.1246435629568678
he thinks you’re not a gentleman	1.1471368154556765
god these bloody english	1.073934252575329
bursting with money and <unk>	1.2996755857345796
because he comes from oxford	1.4197569796263265
you know dedalus you have the real oxford manner	1.4448483375052197
he can’t make you out	1.2382508571625028
o my name for you is the best kinch the knife blade	1.5598640218341517
he shaved warily over his chin	1.2158602324122896
—he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said	1.4245098348818892
where is his <unk>	1.128675111159706
were you in a funk	1.4797196193886821
—i was stephen said with energy and growing fear	1.4866528863225157
out here in the dark with a man i don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther	1.8877756055342998
you saved men from drowning	1.1603251510891588
i’m not a hero however	1.5688227026897508
buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade	1.5493055368811959
he <unk> down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily	1.6723624319722936
he came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into stephen’s upper pocket said <unk> us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor	1.596838805838912
stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief	1.646230229637892
buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly	1.220169246000729
then gazing over the handkerchief he said —the bard’s noserag	1.6513880956380995
a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen	1.280420545413586
you can almost taste it can’t you	1.3959605258709546
he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay his fair <unk> hair stirring slightly	1.5415484713320349
isn’t the sea what algy calls it a great sweet mother	1.4345865374076312
ah dedalus the greeks	1.1442028601184826
i must teach you	1.058125397410879
you must read them in the original	1.7700588773894095
she is our great sweet mother	1.1759232603896452
stephen stood up and went over to the parapet	1.9939034712802908
leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the <unk> of kingstown	3.1793071718203376
he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen’s face	1.641370290279045
—the aunt thinks you killed your mother he said	1.3727335085481287
that’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you	1.6350888557148522
—someone killed her stephen said gloomily	1.2857127139992035
—you could have knelt down damn it kinch when your dying mother asked you buck mulligan said	1.4032613134097884
i’m <unk> as much as you	1.7417318926956216
but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her	1.8266049582476052
there is something sinister in you	1.1706006515519594
he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek	1.371500686345176
a <unk> smile curled his lips	1.3298725863657017
—but a lovely mummer	1.1729041389462767
he murmured to himself	1.0740781223808247
kinch the <unk> mummer of them all	1.4435588591583397
he shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously	1.4320065828911113
stephen an elbow rested on the <unk> granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the <unk> edge of his shiny black coat sleeve	2.094128997869579
pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart	1.4265141502262526
silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes	1.4365168421226946
across the <unk> <unk> he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the <unk> voice beside him	3.372631466912242
the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid	1.4044154564054505
a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her <unk> liver by fits of loud groaning <unk>	1.6190701875739835
buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade	1.347412736876792
he said in a kind voice	2.3170176543584375
i must give you a shirt and a few <unk>	1.7066825251836957
how are the secondhand <unk>	1.3288964811501016
—they fit well enough stephen answered	1.1864945239210218
buck mulligan <unk> the hollow beneath his underlip	1.7041970584359953
—the mockery of it he said <unk>	2.103646427899017
<unk> they should be	1.1188086136951159
god knows what <unk> <unk> left them off	1.7897893020202122
i have a lovely pair with a hair <unk> grey	1.7027303002616783
you’ll look spiffing in them	1.0912207176352244
i’m not joking kinch	1.0620817257525845
you look damn well when you’re dressed	1.318083961153915
i can’t wear them if they are grey	1.6314603674447377
—he can’t wear them buck mulligan told his face in the mirror	1.6881827523951467
he kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers	1.376775458889823
he folded his razor neatly and with stroking <unk> of fingers felt the smooth skin	1.3392013212876996
stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its <unk> mobile eyes	2.0951723887412856
—that fellow i was with in the ship last night said buck mulligan says you have g	1.764336585907149
he’s up in <unk> with connolly norman	1.9153871299425484
general paralysis of the insane	1.1873790957301276
he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea	1.536266418960726
his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth	1.3903370800271613
laughter seized all his strong <unk> trunk	1.2390706770978437
—look at yourself he said you dreadful bard	1.4341269502389564
stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack	1.6859667850867566
as he and others see me	1.3108869808185033
who chose this face for me	1.1972884626522609
this dogsbody to rid of vermin	1.1717521014689651
it asks me too	1.1228267491207229
—i pinched it out of the <unk> room buck mulligan said	2.6499419232462347
it does her all right	1.1962369731659306
the aunt always keeps <unk> servants for malachi	1.1867690397058852
lead him not into <unk>	1.1804058268163808
and her name is ursula	1.4501121972242497
laughing again he brought the mirror away from stephen’s peering eyes	1.5430226889505694
—the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said	1.5352278840751172
drawing back and pointing stephen said with bitterness —it is a symbol of irish art	1.5097324819708375
the cracked lookingglass of a servant	1.0677867799964327
buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen’s and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them	1.547618577311914
god knows you have more spirit than any of them	1.4601112474994553
he fears the <unk> of my art as i fear that of his	2.0932353442113043
the cold steel pen	1.3087810422989432
<unk> lookingglass of a servant	1.0832365855042763
tell that to the <unk> chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea	2.2531528210261706
he’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman	1.347941089574848
his old fellow made his tin by selling <unk> to <unk> or some bloody swindle or other	2.0504386807861166
god kinch if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island	1.6762594693588588
—and to think of your having to beg from these swine	1.6479070437026053
i’m the only one that knows what you are	1.487037894779703
why don’t you trust me more	1.409824337959565
what have you up your nose against me	1.554812907096372
if he makes any noise here i’ll bring down seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave clive <unk>	1.4914007199108694
young shouts of moneyed voices in clive <unk> rooms	1.1996164442967765
palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another	1.2385250851409437
o i shall expire	1.165938142504129
break the news to her gently <unk>	1.2672368221447785
with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by <unk> of magdalen with the tailor’s shears	2.183589623056972
a scared calf’s face gilded with <unk>	1.1363867249097843
i don’t want to be <unk>	1.9302501328702766
don’t you play the giddy ox with me	1.29463479356756
shouts from the open window <unk> evening in the <unk>	1.5797926165892475
a deaf gardener aproned masked with matthew arnold’s face pushes his <unk> on the sombre lawn watching <unk> the dancing <unk> of grasshalms	1.6786120293117333
—let him stay stephen said	1.1050215242449932
there’s nothing wrong with him except at night	1.4470278924065416
buck mulligan asked impatiently	1.2765416397031872
i’m quite frank with you	1.1062317738202563
what have you against me now	1.5368525677678362
they halted looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale	1.630804754974653
stephen freed his arm quietly	1.2068243208867886
—do you wish me to tell you	1.3508665611939104
—yes what is it	1.1421535816899906
i don’t remember anything	1.2730100620057325
he looked in stephen’s face as he spoke	1.4145334891381978
a light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes	1.6947727202861538
stephen <unk> by his own voice said —do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother’s death	2.024139692749822
buck mulligan frowned quickly and said —what	1.410907367258582
i can’t remember anything	1.0725099674181569
i remember only ideas and sensations	1.1363545826574863
what happened in the name of god	1.6684813959798608
—you were making tea stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water	1.5614292728127088
your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom	2.225740349850855
she asked you who was in your room	1.7872680138525951
what did i say	1.3766101091311842
—you said stephen answered o it’s only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead	1.317540134105495
a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligan’s cheek	1.412191383424883
—did i say that	1.1611984963816973
what harm is that	1.0675131323616034
he shook his <unk> from him nervously	1.5632842516074925
—and what is death he asked your mother’s or yours or my own	1.3359920264680318
you saw only your mother die	1.2593738405332395
i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the <unk>	1.5652447468285782
it’s a beastly thing and nothing else	1.2517350369487164
it simply doesn’t matter	1.0700710327089074
you wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you	1.5630977852003387
to me it’s all a mockery and beastly	1.4078207987564761
her cerebral lobes are not functioning	1.2091887413114066
she calls the doctor sir peter <unk> and picks <unk> off the quilt	1.6444684421614877
humour her till it’s over	1.1776823741389142
i didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother	2.2653057745897343
he had spoken himself into boldness	1.1807365767464126
stephen <unk> the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly —i am not thinking of the offence to my mother	1.7028427407561808
—of the offence to me stephen answered	1.5579047495129648
buck mulligan swung round on his heel	1.2666517264900525
—o an impossible person	1.0664272564532449
he walked off quickly round the parapet	1.266217376432411
stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland	1.4371762257076621
sea and headland now grew dim	1.1425345807884055
pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks	1.6823693355025315
a voice within the tower called loudly —are you up there mulligan	1.4479092524160504
—i’m coming buck mulligan answered	1.1605545898926604
he turned towards stephen and said —look at the sea	1.8880169017559383
what does it care about <unk>	1.2455281803898195
chuck loyola kinch and come on down	1.317405768645972
the sassenach wants his morning rashers	1.1185866069086723
his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof —don’t <unk> over it all day he said	1.830524832525796
give up the moody brooding	1.195450485199108
<unk> floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed	1.3995731474014599
<unk> and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by <unk> hurrying feet	1.4294400931331266
white breast of the dim sea	1.2855693694825627
the twining <unk> two by two	1.2037683060508202
a hand plucking the <unk> <unk> their twining chords	2.3359586922292803
<unk> wedded words shimmering on the dim tide	1.2484975034983241
a cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green	1.3056363347260098
it lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters	1.4799338707830567
<unk> song i sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords	1.808295838648949
silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside	1.6430651423744527
she was crying in her wretched bed	1.2551483728639952
her secrets old <unk> tasselled <unk> powdered with <unk> a <unk> of amber beads in her locked drawer	1.8410876555688664
a <unk> hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl	1.9340745908534835
she heard old <unk> sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang i am the boy that can enjoy <unk>	1.6993735049317613
<unk> mirth folded away <unk>	1.121286094468943
and no more turn aside and brood	1.2333306798273762
folded away in the memory of nature with her toys	1.7314820495367342
memories <unk> his brooding brain	1.2027176958878922
her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament	1.696456941724114
a <unk> apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening	1.6141573452378495
her shapely <unk> reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts	1.4433002294930444
in a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes	1.4797786664549895
her <unk> eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul	1.526484144264754
the <unk> to light her agony	2.095028457691345
ghostly light on the tortured face	1.4550850751989697
her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees	1.3111315802434298
her eyes on me to strike me down	1.5429416274715337
liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat	2.202211399217706
let me be and let me live	1.709904512135903
buck mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower	1.3971646411461973
it came nearer up the staircase calling again	1.607584052074223

or leave it there all day forgotten friendship	1.3865027797947562

in the gloomy domed <unk> of the tower buck mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow	1.902441694148071
two shafts of soft daylight fell across the <unk> floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning	1.6908413695533577
—we’ll be choked buck mulligan said	1.1528256646578077

haines stood at the doorway looking out	1.5298517603721569
stephen <unk> his <unk> valise to the table and sat down to wait	2.464970314143942
buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him	1.7315567089734711

he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows —can you recall brother is mother grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the <unk>	1.681157051311808
—i doubt it said stephen gravely	1.3168992115911045

mother grogan was one imagines a <unk> of mary ann	2.0975258251434266
buck mulligan’s face smiled with delight	1.2308318660465845
he said in a <unk> sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly	2.078460226563408

but hising up her petticoats	1.2468670354326872
he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned	1.3689516453599868
the doorway was darkened by an entering form	1.2428013560617752
—come in ma’am mulligan said	1.1042001042206262

—that’s a lovely morning sir she said	1.27275960213438

stephen reached back and took the <unk> from the locker	2.2740542066839167

—is it french you are talking sir	1.3649969932595494
the old woman said to haines	1.6604665243862902

<unk> up and look pleasant haines said to him smiling	1.9519052105668822
stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk	1.3305164436810037
he passed it along the table towards the old woman saying —ask nothing more of me sweet	1.7725077690226716

he turned to stephen and said <unk> dedalus	1.8907443427481534

—our swim first buck mulligan said	1.158444422255237
he turned to stephen and asked blandly —is this the day for your monthly wash kinch	1.586647878431409
then he said to haines —the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month	1.8633049814985698
—all ireland is washed by the gulfstream stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf	1.5620844651936256
haines from the corner where he was <unk> easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke —i intend to make a collection of your <unk> if you will let me	1.997733002135489
they wash and tub and scrub	1.1845255675875637
yet here’s a spot	1.1246287325632158
—that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good	1.5550145059473086
buck mulligan kicked stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone —wait till you hear him on hamlet haines	1.7079035077350249
—well i mean it haines said still speaking to stephen	1.4062023092888507

—would i make any money by it	1.3034333122284951
haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the <unk> of the hammock said —i don’t know i’m sure	2.887233492393303
he strolled out to the doorway	2.005817419909434
buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour —you put your hoof in it now	1.723292011982533
what did you say that for	1.6862207661347777
the problem is to get money	1.3049398518072033
from the <unk> or from him	3.3713067737560007
it’s a toss up i think	1.2110673568083434
—i blow him out about you buck mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy <unk> and your gloomy jesuit jibes	2.5280249727431205
—i see little hope stephen said from her or from him	1.5062168660900694
buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen’s arm	1.7475744589357194
—from me kinch he said	1.10644587556487

to hell with them all	1.5151894695122812
let us get out of the kip	2.6585320799573
he stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly <unk> is stripped of his garments	1.5731129138708324
he <unk> his pockets on to the table	2.2438348352646913
—there’s your <unk> he said	1.2929924345081594
and putting on his stiff collar and <unk> tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain	1.571045490315058
his hands plunged and <unk> in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief	2.0344131918427166
god we’ll simply have to dress the character	1.2355204774140842

very well then i contradict myself	1.2118840749787163
a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands	1.7374195830992047
stephen picked it up and put it on	1.9647991942556489
haines called to them from the doorway —are you coming you fellows	1.620504139498025
you have eaten all we left i suppose	1.2650393779461773
<unk> he passed out with grave words and gait saying <unk> with sorrow —and going forth he met butterly	1.5829784895810217
stephen taking his ashplant from its <unk> followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it	1.9837722517815017
he put the huge key in his inner pocket	1.4793057308959372
at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked —did you bring the key	1.6007009109861843
—i have it stephen said preceding them	1.7114354721884228
behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy <unk> the leader shoots of ferns or grasses	1.475565289890817
how dare you sir	1.057078146679227
haines asked —do you pay rent for this tower	1.3125247951105532

—to the secretary of state for war stephen added over his shoulder	1.32964880805237
they halted while haines <unk> the tower and said at last —rather bleak in wintertime i should say	1.4104394419816806

—it has waited so long stephen said listlessly it can wait longer	1.3231433641208747
—you <unk> my curiosity haines said amiably	1.2949539682126732
is it some paradox	1.154409463604346
we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes	1.2471105971079408
he proves by algebra that hamlet’s grandson is shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father	1.6743373674009494
haines said beginning to point at stephen	1.2700611387402638
buck mulligan slung his towel <unk> round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to stephen’s ear —o shade of kinch the elder	1.4948712343905355

—we’re always tired in the morning stephen said to haines	1.8878203339266544
and it is rather long to tell	1.6594492548660458
buck mulligan walking forward again raised his hands	1.2876125317249445
—the sacred pint alone can <unk> the tongue of dedalus he said	1.3708716422366887
—i mean to say haines explained to stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of <unk>	1.5092175026209271
that beetles o’er his base into the sea isn’t it	1.4223482516416772
buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak	1.5775705635151014
in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay <unk>	1.4402527940108565
—it’s a wonderful tale haines said bringing them to halt again	1.3995171390004815

—i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said <unk>	1.4312530604780183

he looked at them his <unk> mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety	1.8384895830248487
he moved a <unk> head to and fro the <unk> of his panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice —i’m the <unk> young fellow that ever you heard	2.02967463077325

he held up a forefinger of warning	1.4154501851466446
—if anyone thinks that i amn’t divine he’ll get no free drinks when i’m making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again	1.4508489077694553

he <unk> before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his <unk> hands leaping nimbly <unk> hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries	1.5201113939390507
haines who had been laughing <unk> walked on beside stephen and said —we oughtn’t to laugh i suppose	1.6419170605439948
i’m not a believer myself that is to say	1.6399544390428633
still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesn’t it	1.6597786057566744
—the ballad of joking jesus stephen answered	1.2663595355089596
—o haines said you have heard it before	1.810793199987521

then he went to the dresser took the jug <unk> <unk> had just filled for him poured <unk> milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor	1.7669213636765266
she cried running to lap	1.2970187077775965
he watched the bristles shining <unk> in the weak light as she tipped three times and <unk> lightly	1.8793102154863481

he glanced round him	1.0683732567588253
on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall paused by the bedroom door	1.7215922421565284
she might like something tasty	1.3354424285921704
thin bread and butter she likes in the morning	1.5218461526839806

be back in a minute	1.738979134817858
and when he had heard his voice say it he added —you don’t want anything for breakfast	1.943910816901421
a sleepy soft grunt answered <unk>	1.106693812036644
she didn’t want anything	1.1530464770540254
he heard then a warm heavy sigh softer as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the <unk> jingled	1.9995127573716636

i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act trivial in itself that striking of that match that determined the whole <unk> of both our lives	1.675404309535862
o’molloy resumed <unk> his words —he said of it that stony effigy in frozen music horned and terrible of the human form divine that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live deserves to live	1.535845247897207

—no thanks professor machugh said waving the cigarettecase aside	1.467768165688034
let me say one thing	1.1188630196898424
the finest display of oratory i ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical society	1.5624381659210707
mr justice fitzgibbon the present lord justice of appeal had spoken and the paper under debate was an <unk> new for those days <unk> the revival of the irish tongue	1.6685003365912163
he turned towards myles crawford and said —you know gerald fitzgibbon	1.4204208155659308

he closed his long thin lips an instant but eager to be on raised an <unk> hand to his spectacles and with trembling thumb and <unk> touching lightly the black rims <unk> them to a new focus	1.6897753457370177
impromptu in <unk> tone he addressed j	1.3337440540757382
that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one <unk> in the hall	2.5274608460640553
he wore a loose white silk <unk> and altogether he looked though he was not a dying man	1.9247061941863284
his gaze turned at once but slowly from j	1.4116543120699854
o’molloy’s towards stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground seeking	1.790183059068792
his <unk> linen collar appeared behind his bent head soiled by his withering hair	1.3411910466225099
still seeking he said —when fitzgibbon’s speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply	1.3714916364722611

he began —mr chairman ladies and gentlemen great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend	1.6108627471869204
it seemed to me that i had been transported into a country far away from this country into an age remote from this age that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses	1.7739338350058709
his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech	1.310890726274433
and let our crooked smokes	1.0457354606054257
could you try your hand at it yourself	1.4259658886232125
—and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride	1.7895027213174044
i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me	1.3398395497262652
—why will you jews not accept our culture our religion and our language	1.3429535526927214

vagrants and <unk> are you called the world trembles at our name	1.6628416861638238
a dumb <unk> of hunger cleft his speech	1.336439054071648
he lifted his voice above it boldly —but ladies and gentlemen had the youthful moses listened to and accepted that view of life had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that <unk> admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day	1.7301957388458942
he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on <unk> mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law graven in the language of the <unk>	1.6819692098680037

how did she do	1.3727443076424797
a fine carriage she had	1.1516359781439849

such a queenly mien	1.0601295905323866
father conmee walked down great charles street and glanced at the <unk> free church on his left	1.9266478913695226
the incumbent they called him	1.174433326279112
he felt it incumbent on him to say a few words	1.8957521047763055
but one should be charitable	1.2350498895523103
they acted according to their lights	1.2564695431993467
father conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular road	1.853059459057635
it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare	2.639902575923818
surely there ought to be	1.070383543361025
a band of <unk> schoolboys crossed from richmond street	1.2866886504148554
father conmee greeted them more than once <unk>	1.4101314600545016
father conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked	1.7135862595282758
saint joseph’s church <unk> row	1.1535226610492595

father conmee raised his hat to the blessed sacrament	1.6742318635302462
virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered	1.2681755092405511
and now it was an office or something	1.500443648968816
father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop	1.839869100224691
father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from <unk> and ample cools of butter	1.6045474485219848
he passed grogan’s the <unk> against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in new york	1.3967519212186732
in america those things were continually happening	1.2155211022123853
unfortunate people to die like that <unk>	1.4298628628819263
still an act of perfect contrition	1.4413820575901686
father conmee went by daniel bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two <unk> men lounged	1.58144449173077
they saluted him and were saluted	1.2923840281278014
father conmee passed h	1.0738592609649487
o’neill’s funeral establishment where corny kelleher <unk> figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay	1.4787995497320912
a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable	1.8426030078746847
moored under the trees of <unk> mall father conmee saw a <unk> a <unk> with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated <unk> smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him	1.842565960075558
it was <unk> and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people	1.8195022030907555
on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s	1.336165344580403
of saint francis <unk> church upper gardiner street stepped on to an outward bound tram	1.430112837628979

of saint <unk> church north william street on to newcomen bridge	1.5104515708731532
at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island	1.4543139580780735
father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings a sixpence and five pennies <unk> from his other plump <unk> into his purse	1.7771858381812138
passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket	1.3991500802075454
the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap	1.6497648184313256
father conmee liked cheerful decorum	1.102631253575982
it was a peaceful day	2.48040555924575
the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down	1.4358972260019585
his wife father conmee supposed	1.2011914114636721
a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses	1.7401819339677673
she raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gently <unk> her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily sweetly	1.4336929809957175
father conmee perceived her perfume in the car	1.2241634092819305
he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat	1.9347641482402116
father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head	1.6326942864143592
at <unk> bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight	2.0136770387731113
the conductor pulled the <unk> to stay the car for her	1.9441882257533156
she passed out with her basket and a marketnet and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and father conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you my child that they have been <unk> pray for me	1.715437896342879
but they had so many worries in life so many cares poor creatures	1.7274117589973972
from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick <unk> at father conmee	1.324482510815469
father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver s	1.558643661560443
and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the <unk> of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night	2.0752190859007897
that book by the <unk> jesuit le <unk> des <unk> seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea	1.9552552145987845
those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not d	1.6559943425714494
but they were god’s souls created by god	1.3135011880364065
it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say	1.7216589061833054
at the howth road stop father conmee alighted was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn	1.395213087579653
the malahide road was quiet	1.1161460186647105
it pleased father conmee road and name	1.273329333136505
the joybells were ringing in gay malahide	1.5914892255379844
lord talbot de malahide immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining	1.3582644671522854
then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day	1.6782189300395067
those were old <unk> days loyal times in joyous <unk> old times in the barony	1.45243335440759
father conmee walking thought of his little book old times in the barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary <unk> daughter of lord molesworth first countess of belvedere	1.848567688573695
who could know the truth	1.182405121386248
not the jealous lord belvedere and not her <unk> if she had not committed adultery fully <unk> <unk> inter <unk> <unk> <unk> with her husband’s brother	2.194105713785515
she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did	1.6276621998370806
only god knew and she and he her husband’s brother	1.5339229313810772
father conmee thought of that <unk> <unk> needed however for man’s race on earth and of the ways of god which were not our ways	2.0527530190637857
don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore	1.6493799728808343
he was humane and honoured there	1.1235669127865702

and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven	1.7008036987165964
old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door	1.3835131045963311
—come in come on he won’t eat you says the citizen	1.3712359036326895
so bloom <unk> in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks terry was martin cunningham there	1.9804346019044958
—o christ <unk> says joe reading one of the letters	2.04286223739383
listen to this will you	1.516938264937504
and he starts reading out one	1.5260577937548012

—hold hard says joe i have a special <unk> of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain honoured sir my terms is five <unk>	1.6072667935265317
—and a <unk> bloody <unk> he is too says the citizen	1.963071284574314
—and the dirty scrawl of the wretch says joe	2.3178414902368556
here says he take them to hell out of my sight alf	1.9928144397514354
hello bloom says he what will you have	1.419735255518285
so they started arguing about the point bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar	1.9358692319425668
gob he’s a prudent member and no mistake	1.316795875337373
and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it	1.6710723355816823
—they’re all <unk> says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses	1.592828316642018
and he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull	1.7674461430370096
in the dark land they <unk> the <unk> knights of the razor	2.7161305504342743
their deadly coil they grasp yea and therein they lead to <unk> whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on <unk> suffer it even so saith the lord	1.4119636765137988
so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the <unk> of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time i’m told those <unk> does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on	1.6876124757881479
—there’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on says alf	1.2928985961150967
—the poor <unk> <unk> that’s being hanged says alf	1.3522420132188444
—god’s truth says alf	1.070245384262192
i heard that from the head <unk> that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady the invincible	1.9706840645159318
he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker	1.885089313343584
<unk> passion strong in death says joe as someone said	1.414911762167105
—that can be explained by science says bloom	1.2779158561702753
it’s only a natural phenomenon don’t you see because on account of the	1.7870654982017926
and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon	1.9365166160729161
the distinguished <unk> herr professor <unk> <unk> tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous <unk> of the <unk> vertebrae and consequent <unk> of the <unk> cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to <unk> produce in the human subject a violent <unk> <unk> of the nerve centres of the genital <unk> thereby causing the elastic pores of the <unk> <unk> to rapidly dilate in such a way as to <unk> facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been <unk> by the faculty a <unk> upwards and <unk> <unk> erection in <unk> mortis per <unk> <unk>	1.3303531496171406
so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of <unk> and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by <unk> <unk> and a new ireland and new this that and the other	1.6265507027536246
talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought	2.025230095673536
mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his <unk>	1.5074356256316495
and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get	1.6112599766879663
so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him —give us the paw	1.630564023290925
give the paw doggy	1.225304511818346

arrah bloody end to the paw he’d paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool <unk> of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and <unk> dog and intelligent dog give you the bloody <unk>	1.9895334167603036
then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a <unk> tin he told terry to bring	2.2576288993201272
gob he <unk> it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more	2.2241110392477728
near ate the tin and all hungry bloody mongrel	1.2685695568761395
and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point the brothers <unk> and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country the tommy moore touch about sara curran and she’s far from the land	1.5252911650667695

the fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a <unk>	1.5558507613050212
time they were stopping up in the city arms pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked <unk> of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the <unk> playing <unk> to come in for a bit of the <unk> in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her <unk> and taking the lout out for a walk	1.566048452832833
and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and by the holy farmer he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of <unk> and by herrings if the three women didn’t near roast him it’s a queer story the old one bloom’s wife and mrs o’dowd that kept the hotel	1.6378937069540642
jesus i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat	1.6838140186311061

—the memory of the dead says the citizen taking up his <unk> and glaring at bloom	2.331140672713492
—ay ay says joe	1.1101573719653681

the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us	1.3454587625719006
the last farewell was affecting in the extreme	1.2392229051965131
from the <unk> far and near the funereal <unk> tolled <unk> while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums <unk> by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance	1.7345325428615264
the <unk> claps of thunder and the <unk> flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle	1.5296987695470188
a <unk> rain poured down from the <unk> of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest <unk> five hundred thousand persons	2.0427293870218177
a <unk> of dublin metropolitan police <unk> by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and <unk> band whiled away the intervening time by <unk> rendering on their <unk> instruments the <unk> melody <unk> to us from the cradle by <unk> plaintive muse	1.9187520990478337

our two <unk> <unk> did a roaring trade with their <unk> among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their <unk> pennies	1.7267599431455685
the children of the male and female <unk> hospital who thronged the windows <unk> the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of <unk> the poor <unk> and <unk> children a genuinely instructive treat	1.8529220216409523
the viceregal <unk> which included many wellknown ladies was <unk> by their <unk> to the most favourable positions on the <unk> while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was accommodated on a <unk> directly opposite	2.1429819096947775

all the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the <unk> possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless <unk> which they had been called upon to witness	1.7660415252820731
an animated altercation in which all took part ensued among the f	1.312677092289779
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of march was the correct date of the birth of ireland’s patron saint	1.6464682053637305
in the course of the argument cannonballs <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> umbrellas catapults knuckledusters <unk> lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged	1.844503651274028
the readywitted <unk> suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted	1.466141978491883
constable macfadden was heartily congratulated by all the f	1.4910525416395939

commendatore beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the <unk> armchair it was explained by his legal adviser <unk> <unk> that the various articles <unk> in his thirtytwo pockets had been <unk> by him during the <unk> from the pockets of his junior <unk> in the hope of bringing them to their senses	1.9429496147158305
he announced his presence by that gentle <unk> cough which so many have tried <unk> to <unk> <unk> yet withal so characteristic of the man	1.7203105458264123
the arrival of the <unk> <unk> was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more <unk> foreign delegates <unk> vociferously in a medley of cries <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vive allah amid which the ringing <unk> of the delegate of the land of song a high double f recalling those <unk> lovely notes with which the eunuch <unk> <unk> our <unk> was easily <unk>	1.5160826983319609
it was exactly seventeen o’clock	1.1101681049054868
the signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared the <unk> <unk> sombrero which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of <unk> being removed by his medical adviser in attendance dr <unk>	1.7240587130361529
the learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death <unk> knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater his cassock above his hoary head and offered up to the throne of grace <unk> prayers of supplication	1.5674713839884296
hard by the block stood the grim figure of the <unk> his visage being concealed in a <unk> pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes <unk> furiously	2.1308114527532855
as he awaited the fatal signal he <unk> the edge of his horrible weapon by <unk> it upon his brawny forearm or <unk> in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office	1.737221812387857
on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife the various finely tempered <unk> <unk> specially supplied by the <unk> firm of <unk> messrs john round and sons <unk> a <unk> <unk> saucepan for the reception of the <unk> <unk> blind <unk> and <unk> etc when <unk> extracted and two commodious <unk> <unk> to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim	1.6618362775387496
the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when <unk> to that beneficent institution	2.2877073775442685
the <unk> and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake	1.7283505615405454
the hero folded her <unk> form in a loving embrace murmuring <unk> <unk> my own	1.6927710649681644
encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable <unk> of his person which the <unk> of prison garb permitted her <unk> to reach	2.023526502124016
she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever <unk> his memory that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a <unk> match in <unk> park	1.9190141153947582
she brought back to his recollection the happy days of <unk> childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and oblivious of the dreadful present they both laughed heartily all the spectators including the venerable <unk> joining in the general merriment	1.570407752330546
that monster audience simply rocked with delight	1.1592342269316267
but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time	1.449483771984192
a fresh torrent of tears burst from their <unk> <unk> and the vast concourse of people touched to the inmost core broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the aged <unk> himself	2.117662018932593
big strong men officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record <unk>	1.8926974097882663
a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford <unk> noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex stepped forward and presenting his visiting card <unk> and genealogical tree solicited the hand of the <unk> young lady <unk> her to name the day and was accepted on the spot	1.7623880140871306
every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful <unk> of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young <unk> the <unk> by the way of one of the most timehonoured names in <unk> history placed on the finger of his blushing <unk> an expensive engagement ring with <unk> set in the form of a <unk> shamrock the excitement knew no bounds	1.5160826983319609
nay even the stern <unk> lieutenantcolonel tomkin maxwell <unk> <unk> who presided on the sad occasion he who had blown a considerable number of <unk> from the <unk> without flinching could not now restrain his natural emotion	1.8596616399754347
with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard by those privileged <unk> who happened to be in his immediate entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering <unk> —god blimey if she aint a <unk> that there bleeding tart	1.6686853465661602
blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down <unk> way	1.4800322535653507
so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the <unk> that can’t speak their own language and joe <unk> in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old <unk> with his <unk> stump that he <unk> off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink the curse of ireland	1.6265507027536246
gob he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint	1.4810640606815364
and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my <unk> lay and there was a fellow with a <unk> blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen <unk> going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob <unk> entertainment don’t be talking	1.539926526059492
ireland sober is ireland free	1.1210594758363819
and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of	1.603561755439953
and one or two sky <unk> having an eye around that there was no <unk> on with the females hitting below the belt	1.7763390639048418
so <unk> as i was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me	1.8513990860244218
i’d train him by kindness so i would if he was my dog	2.03873240839611
give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him	1.5880428493080905
—afraid he’ll bite you	1.0654713875115709
says the citizen jeering	2.6918677994606246
but he might take my leg for a <unk> so he calls the old dog over	2.1038461741752745
—what’s on you garry	1.183377826492286
then he starts <unk> and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling letting on to answer like a duet in the opera	1.9228773786183562
such growling you never heard as they let off between them	1.419086514805399
someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono <unk> to the papers about the <unk> order for a dog the like of that	2.0842847562879534
growling and <unk> and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the <unk> dropping out of his jaws	2.983356830634114
all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of <unk> given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the <unk> of garryowen and recently <unk> by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry	1.7160549056802352
the exhibition which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully <unk> dietary system <unk> among other <unk> the recitation of verse	1.6527888227936531
our greatest living <unk> expert wild horses shall not drag it from us	1.2760464271261303
has left no stone <unk> in his efforts to <unk> and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance the italics are ours to the <unk> of ancient celtic bards	2.0162056482272463
we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who <unk> his identity under the graceful <unk> of the little sweet branch has familiarised the <unk> world but rather as a contributor d	1.8464451359250376
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening <unk> of the <unk> and more personal note which is found in the <unk> effusions of the famous <unk> and of <unk> <unk> to say nothing of a more modern <unk> at present very much in the public eye	2.023589647725157
we <unk> a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication	1.6281228159712076
the <unk> system of the canine original which recalls the <unk> <unk> and <unk> rules of the welsh <unk> is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught	1.8659597576246278
perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if <unk> verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed <unk>	1.8192427217371399
the curse of my <unk> seven days every day and seven dry <unk> on you barney kiernan has no <unk> of water to cool my courage and my guts red roaring after lowry’s lights	1.7288897712666587
so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and gob you could hear him lapping it up a mile off	1.7067738286218461
—i will says he a chara to show there’s no ill feeling	1.4828567852657693

as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham don’t you see about this insurance of poor dignam’s	1.8062750297554557
martin asked me to go to the house	2.5935788453549247
you see he dignam i mean didn’t serve any notice of the <unk> on the company at the time and <unk> under the act the <unk> can’t recover on the policy	2.3865017054296302
<unk> wars says joe laughing that’s a good one if old shylock is landed	1.6038556913783388
so the wife comes out top dog what	1.299427363471899
—well that’s a point says bloom for the wife’s admirers	1.6047377238661484
—the wife’s advisers i mean says bloom	1.406638826909748
then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed <unk> the money and if now the wife or the widow <unk> the <unk> right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act	1.5947870582948211
he was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court	1.835743040641111

so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer a finer than poor little willy that’s dead to tell her	1.8529220216409523
choking with bloody <unk>	1.0289307978161588
and shaking bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that	1.4458352403621644
you’re a rogue and i’m another	1.3132477061466654

they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets building <unk> as children do or playing with their big coloured ball happy as the day was long	1.5180833939145122
and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight	1.6495797278637792
cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty <unk> in his chin	1.8802495238423038

and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother	1.6301378445681014
but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and master jacky	1.854337766817965
boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule	1.533841629345047
the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be <unk> improved by a <unk> like the martello tower had	2.250632499101934
but if master tommy was <unk> master jacky was selfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little irishman’s house is his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe <unk> came to grief and alas to relate	1.5350968935617348
the <unk> castle too	1.1204088679588118
needless to say the cries of <unk> master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends	1.8950102779677667
—come here tommy his sister called <unk>	1.237621485050349
and you jacky for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand	1.341685245618429
wait till i catch you for that	1.7447315373568266
his eyes misty with <unk> tears master tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins	1.4199880608389885
and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure	1.9641016393175004
his little man o’ war top and <unk> were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of <unk> over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit	1.7094425794911408
still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the <unk> and shook her hand at master jacky the <unk> and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him her eyes dancing in admonition	1.9794533256975193

cissy’s quick motherwit <unk> what was <unk> and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes	1.7936791639223317
but who was gerty	1.1844754663753032
gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions lost in thought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see	1.4665408126493849
she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as <unk> often said she was more a giltrap than a macdowell	1.705722453882489
her figure was slight and graceful <unk> even to <unk> but those iron <unk> she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow <unk> female pills and she was much better of those <unk> she used to get and that tired feeling	1.8777485916993695
the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its <unk> <unk> though her <unk> mouth was a genuine <unk> bow <unk> perfect	1.8354453605399714
her hands were of finely <unk> alabaster with <unk> fingers and as white as <unk> and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk <unk> either	1.7963884478804346
bertha supple told that once to edy boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty the girl chums had of course their little <unk> from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again	1.715437896342879
honour where honour is due	1.1167554354890021
there was an innate refinement a languid queenly <unk> about gerty which was <unk> <unk> in her delicate hands and higharched instep	1.9135805899857712
had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician <unk> at her feet vying with one another to pay their <unk> to her	1.6378937069540642
mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent to her <unk> face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaning that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist why have women such eyes of <unk>	1.6121358952238627
gerty’s were of the <unk> irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows	1.9340455971664696
time was when those brows were not so <unk> <unk>	1.4669813803293437
it was madame <unk> <unk> <unk> of the woman beautiful page of the princess <unk> who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion and she had never regretted it	1.9097529470513692
then there was blushing <unk> cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose	1.6925362873971392
that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one	1.641562167618334
but gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair	1.257906163463343
it was dark brown with a natural wave in it	1.4281094378340116
she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it <unk> about her pretty head in a <unk> of <unk> clusters and pared her nails too thursday for wealth	2.34049919482485
and just now at edy’s words as a <unk> flush delicate as the faintest <unk> crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish <unk> that of a surety god’s fair land of ireland did not hold her equal	1.6539212545815596
for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes	1.596278608283187
she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue	1.5400438701057377
inclination <unk> her to speak out dignity told her to be silent	1.995911087592929
the pretty lips <unk> awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the <unk> of a young may morning	2.1360200357302213
as per usual <unk> nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window	1.9035559946258815

little <unk> he perhaps for what she felt that dull <unk> void in her heart sometimes piercing to the core	1.6413273676538571
yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time	1.5768223955575622
they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph	1.7041418053391124
but he was <unk> handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so <unk> clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden	1.3809784956898055
gerty was dressed simply but with the <unk> taste of a <unk> of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out	2.6410551133031195
a neat blouse of electric blue <unk> by dolly <unk> because it was expected in the lady’s pictorial that electric blue would be worn with a smart <unk> opening down to the division and kerchief pocket in which she always kept a piece of <unk> scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection	1.5975587751701121
she wore a <unk> little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an <unk> of <unk> chenille and at the side a <unk> bow of silk to tone	2.1062254210813656
all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clery’s summer sales the very it slightly <unk> but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny	1.5171194322323998
she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her	1.5772100459526395
and when she put it on the <unk> to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew	2.6097787136580135
her shoes were the newest thing in footwear edy boardman <unk> herself that she was very <unk> but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell a five and never would ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart <unk> over her higharched instep	1.5976255456988824
her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in <unk> hose with <unk> heels and wide garter tops	1.6050662670822549
as for <unk> they were gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her	1.6611090928604033
she had four <unk> sets with awfully pretty <unk> three garments and <unk> extra and each set <unk> with different coloured ribbons rosepink pale blue mauve and <unk> and she <unk> them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and <unk> them and she had a <unk> to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those <unk> as far as she’d see them <unk> the things	1.6265507027536246
she was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a friday	1.361220783576622
and yet and yet	1.124500890594115
that <unk> look on her face	1.2679861295633708

the night of the party long ago in <unk> he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips	2.033924534235076
he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss the first	1.4827631804788468
but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about <unk>	2.3689946710163436
strength of character had never been reggy <unk> strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men	1.629053988417487
but waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over	1.8603536373188738
no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightly <unk> with grey and who would understand take her in his <unk> arms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss	1.6265507027536246
it would be like heaven	2.063362569285455
for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve	1.2993229109392468
with all the heart of her she <unk> to be his only his <unk> bride for riches for poor in sickness in health till death us two part from this to this day forward	1.9293327675885779
then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face bertha supple too and edy little <unk> because she would be twentytwo in november	1.7925803932841056
she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of <unk>	1.4716971704851105
he would be tall with broad shoulders she had always admired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the <unk> for their honeymoon three wonderful weeks	1.8280872760789095
and then when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning they would both have <unk> simple but perfectly served for their own two <unk> and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes	1.6862860584871888
edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little <unk> for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight	2.012578904099072
but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it <unk> be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if you please	1.968419447286612
the temper of him	1.121437122071673
o he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of <unk>	1.9472923641918254
edy told him no no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him	2.091442657445681
—you’re not my sister naughty tommy said	1.2207396495488572
but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career having won the day	1.616697257654438
<unk> for a quiet life laughed ciss	1.7771739683115548
and she tickled tiny <unk> two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor here’s his two horses here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin	1.5797130970224522
<unk> like to give him something she said so i would where i won’t say	2.018009016100629
—on the <unk> laughed cissy merrily	1.2708546617473995
gerty macdowell bent down her head and <unk> at the idea of cissy saying an <unk> thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say <unk> a deep rosy red and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said	2.012781157276482
but not a pin cared ciss	1.2912784215795077
she said with a pert toss of her head and a <unk> tilt of her nose	2.099524122987776
give it to him too on the same place as quick as i’d look at him	2.2341598808795484
<unk> ciss with her <unk> curls	1.6274008870328505
you had to laugh at her sometimes	1.7753265781020533
for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and <unk> ram and when she drew the <unk> too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white	1.7615770326037883
that was just like <unk>	1.48865870466964
there was none to come up to her for fun	1.5590361049493586
but she was sincerity itself one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of your <unk> things too sweet to be wholesome	1.8317569507363085
and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the <unk> anthem of the organ	2.2699930030280915
it was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the <unk> the reverend john hughes s	2.4340492030258716
they were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most <unk> spectacle it was to see in that simple <unk> beside the waves after the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet of the immaculate reciting the <unk> of our lady of <unk> <unk> her to <unk> for them the old familiar words holy mary holy virgin of virgins	1.715437896342879
how sad to poor gerty’s ears	1.2291828144821448
had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink by taking the pledge or those <unk> the drink habit cured in <unk> weekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none	1.495057476521799
over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying <unk> in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or <unk> gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket thinking	1.8990031882039853
but that vile <unk> which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days	1.396630867147417
nay she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by <unk> and had seen her own father a prey to the fumes of <unk> forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low	1.6265507027536246
and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful virgin most merciful	1.3712609541114817
and gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish <unk> or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk	1.7653922849839943
you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face it was a <unk> case of doctor fell or his <unk> nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose	1.7615770326037883
with all his <unk> she loved him still when he sang tell me mary how to woo thee or my love and cottage near <unk> and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with <unk> salad dressing for supper and when he sang the moon hath raised with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried god have mercy on him from a stroke	1.7301957388458942
her mother’s birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken	1.743410405228865
no one would have thought the end was so near	1.648871846698509
now he was laid to rest and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesby’s cork lino artistic standard designs fit for a palace gives tiptop wear and always bright and <unk> in the home	1.5570684047537309
a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house a <unk> angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold	1.917070859346104
and when her mother had those raging <unk> <unk> who was it rubbed the <unk> cone on her forehead but gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking <unk> of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about taking snuff	1.7786550442533708
everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways	1.5842837513381074
it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who <unk> up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the <unk> of lime mr <unk> the grocer’s christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a <unk> hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his <unk> with <unk> chivalry through her lattice window	1.5483652565854986
you could see there was a story behind it	1.9489261271794105
the colours were done something lovely	1.1532188693666845
she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat	1.7635577066214079
the twins were now playing in the most approved <unk> fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that <unk> kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the <unk> rocks	1.7115462985694776
needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but <unk> the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and <unk> the ball	2.118447539444618
our two champions claimed their <unk> with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please	1.753492393546485
the gentleman <unk> the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock	1.6229910522476663
the twins <unk> again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed	1.8479415932528602
gerty smiled assent and bit her lip	1.1534084324287897
a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the <unk>	1.6954966366127497
pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking	2.113819953158237
she felt the warm flush a danger signal always with gerty macdowell <unk> and flaming into her cheeks	1.3908864782267143
till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemed to her the <unk> she had ever seen	1.966458195297625
through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray for us vessel of singular <unk> pray for us mystical rose	1.8771969712593803
and careworn hearts were there and <unk> for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary the most pious virgin’s <unk> power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her	1.566048452832833
the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers	1.3506679677560591
cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air	1.3758073079985156
peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah	1.6515103528021804
and my word didn’t the little chap enjoy that	1.3023197785134673
and then she told him to say papa	2.196825651747653
say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa	1.242881136255095
and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said	1.901474809907834
<unk> ja ja <unk>	1.0066154553483864
cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out holy saint denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him	1.6930283247438684
of course his infant majesty was most <unk> at such toilet <unk> and he let everyone know it <unk> <unk> <unk>	1.774773584408357
and two great big lovely big tears <unk> down his cheeks	1.3445992753944123
it was all no use <unk> him with no <unk> baby no and telling him about the <unk> and where was the <unk> but ciss always readywitted gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly <unk>	2.192345972483447
gerty wished to goodness they would take their <unk> baby home out of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats of twins	1.8631014134043653
she gazed out towards the distant sea	1.5061205809535154
it was like the <unk> that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft	1.6744824380115346
and while she gazed her heart went <unk>	1.292472772264379
yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look	2.587463577507206
his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through read her very soul	1.5038276069139973
wonderful eyes they were <unk> expressive but could you trust them	1.6539886609053684
people were so queer	1.1729735335943823
she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a <unk> the image of the photo she had of martin harvey the <unk> idol only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t <unk> like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an <unk> nose or a slightly <unk> from where he was sitting	1.539926526059492
he was in deep mourning she could see that and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face	2.2481684029445677
she would have given worlds to know what it was	1.9907904577089934
he was looking up so intently so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down	1.8880508311367845
she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away	1.8008389916927132
here was that of which she had so often dreamed	1.951319179940595
it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no one else	2.374443036213513
the very heart of the <unk> went out to him her <unk> because she knew on the instant it was him	2.61044686886449
if he had suffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had been himself a sinner a wicked man she cared not	1.869112784554145
even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her	1.86955296068854
there were wounds that wanted healing with <unk>	1.184164765155855
she was a womanly woman not like other <unk> girls <unk> he had known those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forget the memory of the past then mayhap he would embrace her gently like a real man crushing her soft body to him and love her his <unk> <unk> for herself alone	1.5753186734235158
<unk> of the afflicted	4.314810680081231
well has it been said that <unk> prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven <unk> which <unk> her own heart	1.6587911873230032
gerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glass windows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin’s sodality and father conroy was helping canon o’hanlon at the altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down	1.7565045594820987
he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a <unk> nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the <unk> of saint dominic	1.9194777414598132
he told her that time when she told him about that in confession <unk> up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws he said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god he said and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word	1.4677992676220695
he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a <unk> <unk> with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty <unk> <unk> because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place	1.4277072840416294
the <unk> little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it	1.7337949274864326
little monkeys common as <unk>	1.0809485793020386
someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of them	1.7722739744750373
and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned	1.8230003215347146
so cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out	2.1339550170645594
she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the <unk> she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it	1.701254279852589
she ran with long <unk> strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good <unk> she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible	1.4942339672143998
it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble	1.7209380492552089
that would have been a very charming <unk> for a gentleman like that to witness	2.480556930388464
queen of angels queen of <unk> queen of <unk> of all saints they prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon o’hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon o’hanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the <unk> <unk> <unk> tum	1.2589254117941673
because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself	2.349509661907339
cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a <unk> tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature	1.7455628235338618
gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier a daintier head of <unk> <unk> was never seen on a girl’s <unk> radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening in its <unk>	1.8221973044473585
you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that	1.7200676395864027
she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve	1.725025734991957
she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes	1.7559059819522702
he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey	1.40628488894755
her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose	1.8136385269970379
edy boardman was <unk> it too because she was squinting at gerty half smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse the baby	1.7087957541750107
<unk> little <unk> she was and always would be and that was why no one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers	2.0069954001799406
and she said to gerty —a penny for your thoughts	1.4862998126785805
replied gerty with a smile <unk> by the whitest of teeth	2.1235691412504867
i was only wondering was it late	1.5553727920585372
because she wished to goodness they’d take the <unk> twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late	1.8597547545166473
and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy as <unk> as you like said it was half past kissing time time to kiss again	1.9076234070676321
but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early	2.0657897625696497
—wait said cissy i’ll run ask my uncle peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum	1.45596807366252
so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with his watchchain looking up at the church	2.0745143096065095
passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous <unk> over himself	2.2151971485693065
one moment he had been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet <unk> gentleman <unk> expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure	1.8207548745333315
cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set	1.79571449437164
his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured <unk> there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow <unk>	1.8525143934494688
cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order	1.6520140860187669
then they sang the second verse of the tantum ergo and canon o’hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time	1.5570684047537309
it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets	2.2758459260747883
she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon	2.023589647725157
his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every <unk> literally <unk> at her <unk>	1.559230433744394
if ever there was <unk> admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face	1.7572462260796484
it is for you gertrude macdowell and you know it	1.597651332468364
edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the <unk> caps and <unk> their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o’hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out <unk> de <unk> <unk> eis and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she <unk> about her best boy throwing her over	1.2731955290816555
a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn <unk>	1.423467621546481
it <unk> yes it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the <unk> little cat she was	1.747125868584414
gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so <unk> so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of	1.4328884227931613
she had loved him better than he knew	1.5314707783215769
<unk> deceiver and <unk> like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick <unk> of tears	2.3341149728485884
their eyes were <unk> her <unk> but with a brave effort she <unk> back in sympathy as she glanced at her new <unk> for them to see	2.1054203498676793
—o responded gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud head flashed up	1.3404833095076194
i can throw my cap at who i like because it’s leap year	1.3324044729464328
her words rang out <unk> more musical than the cooing of the <unk> but they cut the silence <unk>	2.07381834070246
there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly <unk> with	2.079438315545009
as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much <unk> and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces	1.8977473074273805
and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him <unk> up on the spot	1.834683692416665
miss puny little edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it the little <unk> because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something <unk> apart in another sphere that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it	1.4556047973707602
edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the <unk> was on his way for master boardman junior	2.008100300814506
and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go <unk> and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleeful eyes and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat <unk> and baby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to all and <unk> on to his brandnew dribbling bib	1.6744824380115346
he has his bib destroyed	1.3462740271067588
the slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights	1.3841996536943935
gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate <unk> by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet <unk> because canon o’hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands	1.4384498882876628
how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse of erin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the <unk> belfry through the dusk hither thither with a tiny lost cry	2.0399540840028765
and she could see far away the lights of the <unk> so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of <unk> because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book the lamplighter by miss cummins author of <unk> vaughan and other tales	1.4677992676220695
for gerty had her dreams that no one knew of	1.5320424950970444
she loved to read poetry and when she got a <unk> from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her <unk> which though it did not err on the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean	1.8728793037756655
it was there she kept her girlish treasure <unk> the tortoiseshell combs her child of mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine her alabaster <unk> and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in hely’s of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the <unk>	1.4277072840416294
art thou real my ideal	1.118698257416835
it was called by louis j walsh <unk> and after there was something about twilight wilt thou ever	2.0563573959963164
and <unk> the beauty of poetry so sad in its <unk> loveliness had <unk> her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her one by one and but for that one <unk> she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it	1.7455628235338618
but it must end she felt	1.2592101780571037
if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her	1.7048822125440901
love laughs at <unk>	1.0535747274053604
she would make the great sacrifice	1.3423187930225662
her every effort would be to share his thoughts	1.3135848503222822
dearer than the whole world would she be to him and <unk> his days with happiness	2.1987067761232844
there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse cruel only to be kind	1.9429496147158305
but even <unk> then	1.16620402628685
would it make a very great difference	1.6160068390883295
from everything in the least <unk> her <unk> nature instinctively <unk>	2.150540600278797
she <unk> that sort of person the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour <unk> the sex and being taken up to the police station	1.748577188513948
no no not that	1.1465256396422783
they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the <unk> of society with a big ess	2.2303848498316263
perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall	2.1157701328053915
she thought she understood	1.3445793454499002
she would try to understand him because men were so different	1.376691192412492
the old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes	1.4315719890750742
she would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide	2.22859236048987
come what might she would be wild <unk> free	1.4545514857833737
canon o’hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and <unk> and the choir sang <unk> dominum omnes <unk> and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and <unk> edy asked wasn’t she coming but jacky caffrey called out —o look cissy	1.8329807108324359
and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church blue and then green and purple	1.6631015714308854
—it’s fireworks cissy caffrey said	1.173858806226068
and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church helterskelter edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running	1.9491415664639022
—come on gerty cissy called	1.1198568912783111
it’s the bazaar fireworks	1.139064371898259
she had no intention of being at their beck and call	1.4985041197424833
if they could run like <unk> she could sit so she said she could see from where she was	1.8267023811417529
the eyes that were <unk> upon her set her pulses tingling	1.6897585498718226
she looked at him a moment meeting his glance and a light broke in upon her	1.535976873227484
his hands and face were working and a <unk> went over her	2.015757585674723
but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips	1.8726649714895782
besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too my dear and winny rippingham so mad about <unk> photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did	1.5848931924611136
and jacky caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air a soft thing to and fro dark	1.6876124757881479
and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hush they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it high high almost out of sight and her face was <unk> with a divine an <unk> blush from straining back and he could see her other things too <unk> knickers the <unk> that <unk> the skin better than those other <unk> the green four and eleven on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous <unk> half offered like those skirtdancers <unk> so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking looking	1.1916319307657184
she would <unk> have cried to him <unk> held out her <unk> slender arms to him to come to feel his lips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girl’s love a little strangled cry <unk> from her that cry that has rung through the ages	1.7898701775650985
and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o	1.350954971524664
then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o	1.9479091806488746
in <unk> and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah	1.9725988672778103
they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden o so lovely o soft sweet soft	1.455768874572988
then all <unk> away <unk> in the grey air all was silent	2.5256549271341537
she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly a <unk> little glance of piteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl	1.6066518423842922
he was leaning back against the rock behind	1.3362380249415415
what a brute he had been	1.235308868095299
a fair <unk> soul had called to him and wretch that he was how had he answered	2.2104525292605643
an <unk> cad he had been	1.196491669517827
he of all men	1.1861123911927216
but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered	1.7680751015945373
should a girl tell	1.1796162350011277
no a thousand times no	1.1929197263281461
cissy caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried <unk>	1.6254439765552342
we can see from farther up	1.3174533416120837
gerty had an idea one of love’s little <unk>	1.346388389609058
wonder if he’s too far to	1.2184979328890853
she had to go but they would meet again there and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream of yester eve	1.8098929635979557
she drew herself up to her full height	1.5904265586311854
their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of a strange shining hung <unk> on her sweet <unk> face	1.7966352253780764
she half smiled at him <unk> a sweet <unk> smile a smile that <unk> on tears and then they parted	1.9003329227879575
slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey to little baby boardman	1.6400742529257768
it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and <unk> seaweed	1.6018786365957922
she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly <unk> gerty macdowell was	1.7490493891512149
mr bloom watched her as she <unk> away	1.797547681210976
that’s why she’s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint	1.6378879676320701
thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib	1.5551313293448548

then make it up	1.1498597501920802
pretend to want something awfully then cry off for her sake	1.3068144829764277

after glencree dinner that was when we drove home	1.486047246694898
gnashing her teeth in sleep	1.2044995758025319

like a cat sitting beyond a dog’s jump	1.2777086486180298
women never meet one like that <unk> in the high school drawing a picture of venus with all his belongings on show	2.1485011694776244

look under the bed for what’s not there	1.4802819597919536
longing to get the fright of their lives	1.6279254500876772
sharp as needles they are	1.108455155294127
when i said to molly the man at the corner of cuffe street was goodlooking thought she might like <unk> at once he had a false arm	2.1408564112359976
where do they get that	1.3698363616631795

something the nurse taught me	1.1788952660411802

lord i am wet	1.1867804041843382
swell of her calf	1.1880634296232486
transparent stockings stretched to breaking point	1.1397873303344066
not like that <unk> today	2.3513496054750442
or the one in grafton street	1.3829748925169296
beef to the heel	1.3153643333582727
a monkey puzzle rocket burst spluttering in <unk> <unk>	1.204503797346961
zrads and zrads zrads zrads	1.1111756082781203
and cissy and tommy and jacky ran out to see and edy after with the pushcar and then gerty beyond the curve of the rocks	1.8025261827883727
she smelt an onion	1.0744644000908645
darling i saw your	1.1840431190585978
did me good all the same	1.1958913638099864
off colour after kiernan’s dignam’s	1.1176653006650998
in hamlet that is	1.070545917704416
it was all things combined	1.7430323945537252
when she leaned back felt an ache at the butt of my tongue	1.5389669872102811
your head it simply swirls	1.3470681410767846
might have made a worse fool of myself however	1.4354925210186051
instead of talking about nothing	1.188550771305789
then i will tell you all	1.2324929668655042
still it was a kind of language between us	2.6567184795380743
no gerty they called her	1.1931340015640814
might be false name however like my name and the address dolphin’s barn a blind	1.481642890409694
her maiden name was <unk> brown and she lived with her mother in irishtown	1.5041044181298342
place made me think of that i suppose	1.7925782962262418
all <unk> with the same brush	3.0794505682526925
wiping pens in their stockings	1.2129860908406345
but the ball rolled down to her as if it understood	2.050849944217928
every bullet has its <unk>	1.1147834668732362
course i never could throw anything straight at school	1.4296994100011011
crooked as a <unk> horn	2.319539696761719
sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to <unk> and papa’s pants will soon fit willy and <unk> earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah	1.8088659801036981
keeps them out of harm’s way	1.3580298574068472
washing child washing corpse	1.0713532939240868
children’s hands always round them	1.1197552551878902
cocoanut skulls monkeys not even closed at first sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds	1.3734014483338697
oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck	1.427598091908543
fill it up with wind	1.488951743220135
must call to the hospital	1.2677315327104455
wonder is nurse callan there still	1.190684975382546
she used to look over some nights when molly was in the coffee palace	2.014702125485441
that young doctor o’hare i noticed her brushing his coat	1.281701977520907
and mrs breen and mrs dignam once like that too marriageable	1.4038426601830916
worst of all at night mrs <unk> told me in the city arms	2.008915744459075
husband rolling in drunk stink of pub off him like a polecat	1.6267156635444924
then ask in the morning was i drunk last night	1.7264358636536155
bad policy however to fault the husband	1.1717420476323992
chickens come home to roost they stick by one another like glue	1.4592615382385006
maybe the women’s fault also	1.1670005300014703
that’s where molly can knock spots off them	1.212312042786102
it’s the blood of the south	1.7585012324073062
also the form the figure	1.2351978186070114
hands felt for the opulent	1.2133746120628304
just compare for instance those others	1.224855501189033
wife locked up at home skeleton in the cupboard	1.3659821226436117
allow me to introduce my	1.246549998899574
then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript wouldn’t know what to call her	1.8503266665566174
still there’s destiny in it falling in love	1.2305508951853046
have their own secrets between them	1.219406171849036
chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn’t take them in hand	1.72827341811666
then little chits of girls height of a shilling in coppers with little <unk>	1.5015176902903122
as god made them he <unk> them	1.5291486426909737
sometimes children turn out well enough	1.222811379869946
twice nought makes one	1.071496940892596
or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride	1.2009081740823264
marry in may and repent in december	1.1755831423084302
this wet is very unpleasant	1.192501303985063
well the <unk> is not back	2.459957210537146
other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his <unk>	1.6092511816787718
long and the short of it	1.428045911632955
big he and little she	1.2818816266752509
very strange about my watch	1.1892241539942177
<unk> are always going wrong	1.3827414418674635
wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he	1.6342577473526987
yes i suppose at once	1.2107041822220819
cat’s away the mice will play	1.2193526394607386
i remember looking in pill lane	1.1837466676886923
also that now is magnetism	1.2592468334617575
back of everything magnetism	1.3120347929443654
earth for instance pulling this and being pulled	1.3360489447073636
and time well that’s the time the movement takes	1.4462732709025525
then if one thing stopped the whole <unk> would stop bit by bit	1.5170756747387943
because it’s all arranged	1.1672800871287938
little piece of steel iron	1.2677744169495022
when you hold out the fork	1.2522361258961723
woman and man that is	1.2310537488529885
dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and <unk> you if you’re a man to see that and like a sneeze coming legs look look and if you have any guts in you	1.823330661723432
have to let fly	1.3739699491606154
wonder how is she feeling in that region	1.576996032370112
shame all put on before third person	1.2338184869505064
more put out about a hole in her stocking	1.6091492783761112
molly her underjaw stuck out head back about the farmer in the <unk> and spurs at the horse show	2.0500103422661713
and when the <unk> were in lombard street west fine voice that fellow had	2.5531737555840115
smell that i did	1.1844915065814092
came from the <unk> probably in the paint	2.389209366454644
make their own use of everything	1.2751992157781655
same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear	1.7224399873715326
but lots of them can’t kick the beam i think	1.4489256449542325
keep that thing up for hours	1.2893176615466941
kind of a general all round over me and half down my back	1.8505920386057892
why she waved her hand	1.297598312103679
i leave you this to think of me when i’m far away on the pillow	1.792640612808993
she’d like scent of that kind	1.257526820688235
sweet and cheap soon sour	1.1752877386978535
why molly likes opoponax	1.0714946392007378
her high notes and her low notes	1.2559805950759495
at the dance night she met him dance of the hours	1.3944029519258268
heat brought it out	1.1599530001264078
she was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before	1.6181201603617545
good conductor is it	1.0680548818428783
suppose there’s some connection	1.0743531027675757
for instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark	1.4476777959035096
why did i smell it only now	1.4675300179935626
took its time in coming like herself slow but sure	1.2503040394080882
suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across	1.3150402494601328
because those spice islands cinghalese this morning smell them leagues off	1.2411555790909607
tell you what it is	1.6237692048865866
it’s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin fine like what do you call it gossamer and they’re always spinning it out of them fine as anything like rainbow colours without knowing it	1.8686693619681076
<unk> to everything she takes off	1.202142285856739
<unk> of her stockings	2.4677777133840197
drawers little kick taking them off	1.1523168513826816
byby till next time	1.0637042293720647
know her smell in a thousand	1.2155756876479493
reminds me of strawberries and cream	1.5462476683877597
wonder where it is really	1.2935545943676494
there or the armpits or under the neck	1.2882969418298
because you get it out of all holes and corners	1.9714945480540056
hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something	1.2048991288826028
bag under their tails	1.1671100926761213
one grain pour off odour for years	1.1694479183392101
dogs at each other behind	1.5358995330550418
how do you sniff	1.7703629608468248
very well thank you	1.023770157767909
animals go by that	1.1481794583435077
yes now look at it that way	1.6890679072341157
some women instance warn you off when they have their period	1.4071945500810579
then get a <unk> you could hang your hat on	1.5928718412754959
potted herrings gone stale or	1.115120383229506
please keep off the grass	1.18462553025359
perhaps they get a man smell off us	1.3896223531452385
<unk> gloves long john had on his desk the other day	1.566790272178277
what you eat and drink gives that	1.2319091250915344
must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different	1.6038207432023057
women buzz round it like flies round treacle	1.2946708170353478
<unk> off the altar get on to it at any cost the tree of forbidden priest o father will you	1.6117916589158732
let me be the first to	1.5229783666178252
that <unk> itself all through the body <unk>	1.3130015941228808

dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning	1.2365185352123096
hynes might have paid me that three shillings	1.3483659958396808
still if he works that paragraph	1.576205727281503
bad opinion of me he’ll have	1.2637555883586864
how much do i owe you	1.2434819666276713

see ourselves as others see us	1.0829362665992006
that’s the way to find out	1.821916491947692
ask yourself who is he now	1.5201965569175884
the mystery man on the beach prize titbit story by mr leopold bloom	1.436269017190458

and the traveller leopold was <unk> to him <unk> it had <unk> that they had had ado each with other in the house of <unk> where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be <unk> for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and <unk> as much as he might suffice	1.5570684047537309
and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there	1.8461880311461623
and the traveller leopold said that he should go <unk> for he was a man of <unk> and a <unk>	2.8196572507747577
also the lady was of his avis and <unk> the learningknight though she <unk> well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his <unk>	1.7123995964208674
but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her <unk> ne have him in aught <unk> to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle	2.0349272871992667
and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches <unk> in divers lands and sometime <unk>	1.6514312168349445
and in the castle was set a board that was of the <unk> of <unk> and it was upheld by four <unk> of that country but they durst not move more for <unk>	2.831926838580197
and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great <unk> by <unk> <unk> out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of <unk> and stags that there <unk> <unk>	2.1549536669293605

and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could <unk> a fuller ne richer	1.572057803573256

and these fishes lie in an <unk> water brought there from portugal land because of the <unk> that therein is like to the juices of the <unk>	1.980783876231882
and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a <unk> out of <unk> <unk> out of <unk> that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up <unk> like to a vast mountain	2.1187853261287715
and they teach the serpents there to <unk> themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a <unk> like to mead	2.1911150232332552
and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and <unk> thereto the while all they that were there drank every each	1.4377934940006327
and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took <unk> somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full <unk> he <unk> the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour <unk> not of this <unk>	1.7299216004762479
and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile	1.9309890609280587
thanked be almighty god	1.0583408972448893
this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of <unk> our <unk> liege lord to leave their <unk> for there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time <unk> fast sir leopold heard on the <unk> cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it be not come or now	1.5947870582948211

and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the <unk> and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one <unk> and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently	1.9952623149688797
but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her <unk> for she hath waited marvellous long	1.6828970717920664
and the franklin that had drunken said expecting each moment to be her next	1.3998529147664769
also he took the cup that stood <unk> him for him needed never none asking nor <unk> of him to drink and now drink said he fully <unk> and he quaffed as far as he might to their <unk> health for he was a passing good man of his <unk>	1.9952623149688797
and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in <unk> hall and that was the <unk> man and the <unk> that ever laid <unk> hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him <unk> in the cup	1.8738174228603839

now let us speak of that <unk> that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might	1.9101127113929972
there was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit dixon yclept junior of saint mary <unk> with other his fellows lynch and madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa one crotthers and young stephen that had mien of a <unk> that was at head of the board and costello that men <unk> punch costello all long of a mastery of him <unk> <unk> and of all them reserved young stephen he was the most drunken that <unk> still of more mead and beside the meek sir leopold	1.4077153669117268
but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his <unk>	1.5698021616814228
and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest <unk> <unk> as they <unk> him for that time in the <unk> manner	2.192345972483447
ruth red him love led on with will to wander loth to leave	1.3360827201561207
for they were right witty scholars	1.2261076056040987
and he heard their <unk> each <unk> other as touching birth and <unk> young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne’s house that now was <unk> out of this world and the self night next before her death all <unk> and <unk> had taken counsel of her case	1.6050163175336876
and they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die	1.613509794150104
and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other <unk> the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy	1.5979964708073546
a <unk> god grant	1.3596501970140662
this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our virgin mother the wife should live and the babe to die	1.4278144520009401
in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack	1.4703631504064298
then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and <unk> and for a vow he had made to saint <unk> of <unk> her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved	1.9187520990478337
to whom young stephen had these words following murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk	1.3138690210438624

then said dixon junior to punch costello <unk> he what ends	1.4233988440966796
but he had <unk> drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever <unk> a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so <unk> him to be delivered of his spleen of <unk>	2.1045095434782963
whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi’s praise of that beast the <unk> how once in the <unk> he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint <unk> his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do	1.715437896342879
thereat laughed they all right <unk> only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not <unk> and also for that he <unk> for her that bare whoso she might be or <unk>	1.9886881273598565
then spake young stephen <unk> of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of <unk> of lilith patron of <unk> of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of <unk> mouth to mouth or as <unk> saith by the influence of the <unk> or by the reek of <unk> or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with <unk> <unk> or <unk> in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides	1.4806572771858608
he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was <unk> and how in all our holy mother <unk> ever souls for god’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a <unk> to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that <unk> the <unk> seal even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded	1.6496480740980204
all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so <unk> her person as risk life to save life	1.4818013479259884
a <unk> of mind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he said <unk> as his wont was that as it was informed him who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman and <unk> also with his experience of so <unk> an accident it was good for that mother church <unk> at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort <unk> he <unk> their questions	1.5753186734235158
that is truth <unk> said dixon and or i err a pregnant word	1.3343909113372292
which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared <unk>	1.9426319472697726
but sir leopold was passing grave <unk> his word by cause he still had pity of the <unk> shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was <unk> of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny	1.7455628235338618
and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil <unk> and for his burial did him on a fair <unk> of lamb’s wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie <unk> for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his <unk> happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived <unk> with those <unk> and murdered his goods with whores	1.3211974960367816
about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the <unk> had not shadowed their approach from him that still <unk> it very busily who praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray	1.5739860884596062

he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden being godly certain whiles knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom at the <unk> side spoke to him <unk> words to slumber his great fear advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard the discharge of fluid from the <unk> look you having taken place and all of the order of a natural phenomenon	1.449740670372632
but was young <unk> fear <unk> by <unk> words	1.7965480773693767

indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle	1.451904961563033
why he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding which he had not done	1.9403239241178776
for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show	2.5168734077650923
and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away	1.6945874628556035
by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law	1.5657421665418674

yes pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an <unk> exterior whose name she said is bird in the hand and she <unk> him <unk> from the true path by her <unk> that she said to him as ho you pretty man turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place and she lay at him so <unk> that she had him in her grot which is named two in the bush or by some learned carnal concupiscence	1.3938972755249328

with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was <unk> to sit near by which he did mighty brisk	1.6876124757881479
he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a <unk> or honest <unk> and what belonged of women horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat	2.307998540629567

he took his ordinary at a <unk> and if he had but <unk> into him a mess of broken <unk> or a platter of tripes with a bare <unk> in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue some randy <unk> he had from a <unk> or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides	1.7615770326037883

more like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue	1.2386732496862711
mr stephen a little moved but very <unk> told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief <unk> thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over doctor rinderpest the <unk> <unk> in all <unk> with a <unk> or two of physic to take the bull by the horns	1.8957356524063758
come come says mr vincent plain dealing	1.4938608053629545
he’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he <unk> with a bull that’s irish says he	1.970467552630405
irish by name and irish by nature says mr stephen and he sent the ale purling about an irish bull in an english <unk>	1.4933600393387796
i conceive you says mr dixon	1.3611822724193223
it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas the bravest <unk> of them all with an emerald ring in his nose	1.689408050733671
true for you says mr vincent cross the table and a <unk> into the bargain says he and a plumper and a <unk> bull says he never shit on shamrock	2.428233056444704
he had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving <unk> and <unk> followed after him hanging his <unk> in <unk>	2.20104297505292
what for that says mr dixon but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself	1.727176317612478
so be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing and with that he slapped his <unk> very soundly	1.8417055295725948
but the slap and the blessing stood him friend says mr vincent for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid wife <unk> and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a <unk> or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland	1.5160826983319609
another then put in his word and they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a <unk> and girdle and <unk> on his <unk> and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with <unk> oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s <unk>	1.5753186734235158
by this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to <unk>	1.7508638000242842
to remedy which our <unk> dames and <unk> brought him his <unk> in their <unk> and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their <unk> a mystery and roar and <unk> out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him	1.9429496147158305
ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying by the lord harry green is the grass that grows on the ground	1.6744824380115346
and says mr dixon if ever he got scent of a <unk> in <unk> or the wilds of connemara or a <unk> in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of <unk> out he’d run amok over half the <unk> rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord <unk> orders	1.7615770326037883
i’ll make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good <unk> my father left me	1.5523010753796833
but one evening says mr dixon when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a <unk> he had spade <unk> for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with <unk> he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a <unk> chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a <unk> descendant of the famous champion bull of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is good bog latin for boss of the show	1.4225293134853696
after that says mr vincent the lord harry put his head into a cow’s <unk> in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name	2.113901558294687
then with the water running off him he got into an old <unk> and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal <unk> which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a <unk> table or a <unk> of cotton or a <unk>	1.4384498882876628
in short he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt	1.5017837783808594
they were says mr stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was <unk> as the <unk> women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their <unk> of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect <unk> the yards sprang their <unk> <unk> to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor <unk> her helm ran up the jolly roger gave three times three let the <unk> run pushed off in their <unk> and put to sea to recover the main of america	1.4125375446227544
which was the occasion says mr vincent of the composing by a <unk> of that rollicking chanty <unk> <unk> but a <unk>	2.3222021625590767
a man’s a man for a’ that	1.2771854243753213
our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were <unk> their <unk> accompanied with a friend whom he had just <unk> a young gentleman his name alec bannon who had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or a <unk> in the <unk> and list for the wars	1.79571449437164
mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on	1.8490854802571963
whereat he handed round to the company a set of <unk> cards which he had had printed that day at mr <unk> bearing a legend printed in fair italics mr malachi mulligan	1.7304198416826522
his project as he went on to <unk> was to <unk> from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir <unk> <unk> and sir <unk> <unk> in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed	2.023589647725157
well let us hear of it good my friend said mr dixon	1.615523708827001
i make no doubt it <unk> of <unk>	1.4573238066243788
come be seated both	1.121806365927079
’tis as cheap sitting as standing	1.1497290086317082
mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and <unk> upon his design told his <unk> that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility both the inhibitory and the <unk> whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal <unk> or to a <unk> of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired	1.6618362775387496
it grieved him <unk> he said to see the nuptial couch <unk> of its dearest <unk> and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich <unk> a prey to the <unk> <unk> who hide their <unk> under a <unk> in an <unk> <unk> or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some <unk> <unk> when they might multiply the <unk> of happiness <unk> the <unk> jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep	1.474142020110622
to curb this <unk> which he concluded due to a <unk> of latent heat having advised with certain <unk> of worth and inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the <unk> of lambay island from its holder lord talbot de malahide a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party	1.7782794100389228
he proposed to set up there a national <unk> farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the <unk> of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural	1.7177792585206417
money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains	1.7156348881002488
the <unk> <unk> no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their <unk> and their tempers were warm <unk> for their <unk> would find in him their man	2.281649342199137
after this <unk> which he delivered with much warmth of <unk> mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had <unk> it	2.1028942716806536
they both it seems had been <unk> by the rain and for all their <unk> their pace had taken water as might be observed by mr mulligan’s <unk> of a <unk> grey which was now somewhat piebald	2.1408796677192092
his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty <unk> from all though mr dixon of mary’s excepted to it asking with a <unk> air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle	1.5991748538735635

he could not leave his mother an <unk>	1.7567299686649944
the young man’s face grew dark	1.2195788440394755

she was leading the field	1.0894118530054588
all hearts were beating	1.1243520910145102
even phyllis could not contain herself	1.2574099271893124

but let us bear it as was the ancient wont	1.4564210461220353
mercy on the luckless	1.1889121264507487
he said with a light sigh	2.0584490657028938
she is not the filly that she was	1.5920554790067776
never by this hand shall we behold such another	1.309575274409654

do you remember her vincent	1.569761944213911
i wish you could have seen my queen today vincent said	1.3776922912018381
how young she was and radiant <unk> were scarce fair beside her in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin i do not know the right name of it	1.7267690145933945
the <unk> that shaded us were in bloom the air <unk> with their persuasive odour and with <unk> floating by us	1.8571537736589971
in the sunny <unk> one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with <unk> fruit in them that <unk> sells in his booth near the bridge	1.547475716794514
a week ago she lay ill four days on the couch but today she was free blithe mocked at peril	1.3552326497269978
she is more taking then	1.1613028385730682
mad romp that she is she had pulled her fill as we reclined together	1.5476449860813626
and in your ear my friend you will not think who met us as we left the field	1.6729373688505251
he was walking by the hedge reading i think a brevier book with i doubt not a witty letter in it from <unk> or <unk> to keep the page	1.8024954987341866
the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion feigning to <unk> a slight disorder in her dress a slip of underwood <unk> there for the very trees adore her	1.6179545665183355
when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries	1.555154425895993
but he had been kind	2.6720763767845153
in going by he had blessed us	1.4653560924892668
the gods too are ever kind lenehan said	1.2261638347753177
if i had poor luck with bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more <unk>	1.5314641547857055
he was laying his hand upon a <unk> malachi saw it and withheld his act pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label	1.8539020664552215
warily malachi whispered preserve a druid silence	1.142741815579028
his soul is far away	1.18206164127022
it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born	1.5703642298456122
any object intensely regarded may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods	1.5333446560298398
do you not think it stephen	1.5337244197857038
theosophos told me so stephen answered whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the <unk> of <unk> law	2.108154600571971
the lords of the moon theosophos told me an orangefiery <unk> from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not <unk> the etheric doubles and these were therefore <unk> by the <unk> <unk> from the second constellation	2.246791586984723
however as a matter of fact though the <unk> <unk> about him being in some description of a <unk> or other or <unk> which was entirely due to a <unk> of the <unk> character was not the case at all	2.3713737056616555
the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this <unk> commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as <unk> if not <unk> than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty <unk> in the wrong shop	1.6927313183331665
during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass <unk> by messrs bass and co at burton on <unk> which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract <unk> remark on account of its scarlet appearance	1.7615770326037883
he was simply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings after the moment <unk> <unk> about <unk> days and the turf <unk> two or three private <unk> of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn	1.7770310080835494
eventually however both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the <unk> glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same time however a considerable degree of <unk> in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place	1.4330125702369627
the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an <unk> of the course of life	2.2289768055594203
neither place nor council was lacking in dignity	1.4053651876337163
the <unk> were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on the <unk> and most vital	3.2615723237816656
the high hall of horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old <unk> of that establishment ever listened to a language so <unk>	1.7019728803859397
a gallant scene in truth it made	1.1938971019247016
crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of <unk>	1.704661017398196
there too opposite to him was lynch whose countenance bore already the <unk> of early <unk> and premature wisdom	1.8174880857820468
next the <unk> was the place assigned to costello the eccentric while at his side was seated in <unk> repose the squat form of madden	1.719483416143144
the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in <unk> kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and <unk> manners of malachi <unk> st john mulligan	1.4786607938628038
<unk> at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of <unk> and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of <unk> discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the <unk> <unk> fresh from the <unk> and that vigilant <unk> soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an <unk> dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or <unk> or <unk> could ever <unk> the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has <unk> for ages yet to come	1.3938972755249328
it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted <unk> to which mr s	1.771176300078748
<unk> would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods	1.2819083610359097
science it cannot be too often repeated <unk> with <unk> phenomena	1.923835762025705
the man of science like the man in the street has to face <unk> facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can	1.7214705312872576
there may be it is true some questions which science cannot <unk> <unk> as the first problem submitted by mr l	1.8635913215844455
regarding the future <unk> of sex	1.2415748763796848
must we accept the view of <unk> of <unk> that the right <unk> the <unk> period <unk> others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or <unk> the <unk> factors or is it as most <unk> incline to opine such as <unk> <unk> <unk> lusk <unk> leopold and <unk> a mixture of both	1.7782794100389228
this would be tantamount to a <unk> one of nature’s favourite <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position <unk> felix of the passive element	2.543345761304649
the other problem raised by the same <unk> is scarcely less vital infant mortality	1.5528703782191682
it is interesting because as he <unk> remarks we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways	2.0704142159275674
<unk> the sanitary conditions in which our <unk> citizens contract <unk> <unk> complaints etc by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust these factors he alleged and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets hideous publicity <unk> religious ministers of all denominations mutilated soldiers and sailors exposed scorbutic <unk> the suspended <unk> of dead animals <unk> bachelors and <unk> <unk> he said were <unk> for any and every <unk> in the calibre of the race	1.5848931924611136
<unk> he <unk> would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life genuinely good music agreeable literature light philosophy instructive pictures <unk> <unk> of the classical statues such as venus and apollo artistic coloured photographs of prize babies all these little attentions would <unk> ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most <unk> manner	1.7301957388458942
<unk> some of these <unk> to abdominal trauma in the case of women <unk> subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect private or official culminating in the exposure of newborn infants the practice of criminal abortion or in the <unk> crime of infanticide	1.6677092196637802
<unk> the former we are thinking of neglect is undoubtedly only too true the case he <unk> of <unk> forgetting to count the sponges in the <unk> cavity is too rare to be <unk>	1.9535773175814222
in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many <unk> and <unk> go off so well as they do all things considered and in spite of our human <unk> which often <unk> nature in her intentions	2.069588724783223
an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v	1.3461258954170932
that both <unk> and mortality as well as all other phenomena of evolution tidal movements lunar phases blood temperatures diseases in general everything in fine in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the <unk> flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of <unk> as yet <unk>	1.7782794100389228
still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after <unk> <unk> in early childhood though other children of the same marriage do not must certainly in the poet’s words give us pause	1.7369172806900506
nature we may rest assured has her own good and <unk> reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which <unk> in which <unk> germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend to <unk> at an increasingly earlier stage of development an arrangement which though <unk> of pain to some of our feelings notably the maternal is nevertheless some of us think in the long run <unk> to the race in general in <unk> thereby the survival of the fittest mr s	1.3768571648527583
remark or should it be called an <unk>	1.2790783071581582
that an omnivorous being which can <unk> <unk> <unk> and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such <unk> <unk> as <unk> females emaciated by <unk> <unk> professional gentlemen not to speak of <unk> <unk> and <unk> nuns might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob reveals as nought else could and in a very <unk> light the tendency above alluded to	1.6618362775387496
for the enlightenment of those who are not so <unk> acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal <unk> as this <unk> <unk> and <unk> philosopher who for all his <unk> <unk> in things scientific can scarcely <unk> an acid from an <unk> <unk> himself on being it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our <unk> licensed <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother	1.566048452832833
in a recent public <unk> with mr l	1.3494350384840132

there is no answer he bends again	1.6311527138249085
there is no answer	1.4381474190953492
the name if you call	1.2423972048764462

there is no answer	1.4381474190953492
he sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels	1.2321835876873135
fergus now and pierce	1.179148723346751
he turns on his left side sighing <unk> himself together	1.5541916341628166
he bends again and undoes the buttons of stephen’s waistcoat	1.4388785731816247
he brushes the <unk> from stephen’s clothes with light hand and fingers	1.7421899495963213
he stretches out his arms sighs again and curls his body	1.360456976707541
bloom holding the hat and ashplant stands erect	1.6317596890226855
a dog barks in the distance	1.1879487604615617
bloom <unk> and <unk> his grip on the ashplant	2.6355748533338748
he looks down on stephen’s face and form	1.5180843558178765

best thing could happen him	1.1116085584990218
swear that i will always hail ever conceal never reveal any part or parts art or arts	1.3414765974252483
a <unk> length from the shore	1.2475674274248951
where the tide <unk>	1.0985279252238587
silent thoughtful alert he stands on guard his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master	1.5208031375202953
against the dark wall a figure appears slowly a fairy boy of eleven a changeling <unk> dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet holding a book in his hand	1.550227192745925
he reads from right to left inaudibly smiling kissing the page	1.3198250531040023
bloom <unk> calls inaudibly	1.142170323836516
rudy gazes unseeing into bloom’s eyes and goes on reading kissing smiling	1.3452301562363491
he has a delicate mauve face	1.7266044846577666
on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons	1.2670694354304255
a white <unk> peeps out of his waistcoat pocket	2.322380715266487
— iii — <NUMBER> preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and <unk> him up generally in orthodox <unk> fashion which he very badly needed	1.628283504533121
his stephen’s mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their <unk> let alone drinking purposes hit upon an <unk> by suggesting off the reel the <unk> of the cabman’s shelter as it was called hardly a <unk> away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some <unk> in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral	1.4440241885954521
but how to get there was the rub	1.9898347759273096
for the nonce he was rather <unk> but inasmuch as the duty plainly <unk> upon him to take some <unk> on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned	1.870615437543697
so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being e	2.0487667599563406
ed particularly stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found	1.8110115111405538
accordingly after a few such <unk> as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather <unk> handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along beaver street or more properly lane as far as the <unk> and the distinctly <unk> atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of <unk> street where they made tracks to the left from thence <unk> into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin’s	1.5237960002208242
but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a <unk> plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a <unk> probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the north star hotel and there was no <unk> of its <unk> a quarter of an inch when mr bloom who was anything but a professional <unk> endeavoured to hail it by <unk> a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice	1.5483652565854986
this was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did	1.6782882217987736
so <unk> around by <unk> and the signal house which they shortly reached they proceeded <unk> in the direction of amiens street railway terminus mr bloom being handicapped by the <unk> that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to <unk> the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he <unk> made light of the <unk>	1.6618362775387496
so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent <unk> of jupiter <unk> they <unk> along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey	1.5591711022195518
as it so happened a dublin united tramways company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man <unk> to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly <unk> escape of some little while back	1.725032613727273
they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station the starting point for belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very <unk> locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street famous for its c division police station	1.5658840630526003
bread the staff of life <unk> your bread o tell me where is fancy bread at rourke’s the baker’s it is said	1.5859290007782296
highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was <unk> unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr <unk> or he being the solicitor rather old wall he meant to say or <unk> which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got <unk> about	1.4873521072935114
the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were <unk> <unk> in the service of the crown and as mr bloom put it recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot	1.8957356524063758
never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes	1.8100735123225804
another thing he commented on was <unk> soldiers with <unk> or <unk> of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to <unk> them against <unk> should by any chance they fall out over anything	1.8354427057640423
you <unk> away your time he very <unk> maintained and health and also character besides which the <unk> of the thing fast women of the <unk> ran away with a lot of £	2.2832604302683563
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of <unk> he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and <unk> and possessing <unk> virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically	1.4942339672143998
most of all he commented <unk> on the desertion of stephen by all his <unk> <unk> but one a most glaring piece of <unk> on the part of his brother <unk> under all the <unk>	2.5216343038454867
—and that one was judas stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind	1.538919085014539
<unk> these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps	1.6967156972475865
stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox	1.8785176127420788
he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father’s gumley	1.6394179545624792
to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge	1.5193295281459398
—someone saluted you mr bloom said	1.2171484942343758
a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling <unk>	1.354102543291574
stephen of course started rather <unk> and stopped to return the compliment	1.5078486390820995
stephen that is when the <unk> figure came to close quarters though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley’s breath redolent of rotten <unk>	1.7436960031606872
lord john corley some called him and his <unk> came about in this wise	2.041840059038661
he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division lately deceased who had married a certain katherine brophy the daughter of a <unk> farmer	1.868966805374869
his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine also talbot	1.4362115513304607
this therefore was the reason why the still <unk> young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with <unk> proclivities as lord john corley	1.5322203421978642
taking stephen on one side he had the customary <unk> ditty to tell	1.7316377516747106
not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings	1.591101445078007
his friends had all deserted him	1.1828176223206828
furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a <unk> of a number of other <unk> expressions	2.5838150866265965
he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on god’s earth he could get something anything at all to do	2.000192465978647
no it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was <unk> to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish	1.9952623149688797
anyhow he was all in	1.6788887433065065
—i wouldn’t ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and god knows i’m on the rocks	1.4288323183264557
<unk> be a job tomorrow or next day stephen told him in a boys’ school at dalkey for a gentleman usher	1.614979952432221
you may mention my name	1.1152769026804594
—ah god corley replied sure i couldn’t teach in a school man	1.340467650183812
i was never one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh	1.7148722103008214
i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers	1.3626872448355634
—i have no place to sleep myself stephen informed him	1.428353095321638
corley at the first go off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being <unk> out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street	1.9166408752522253
there was a <unk> in marlborough street mrs <unk> but it was only a tanner touch and full of <unk> but <unk> told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in <unk> street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon for a bob	1.9429496147158305
he was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it	1.5061308727773624
though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corley’s brandnew <unk> on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much <unk>	1.7712478321949754
however <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the <unk> was demolished	1.8957356524063758
but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley’s head that he was living in <unk> and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful	2.1883947483719473
he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for to his <unk> he found his cash missing	1.7615770326037883
a few broken biscuits were all the result of his <unk>	1.5354433155191154
he tried his <unk> to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact	2.3412172985377566
he was altogether too fagged out to <unk> a thorough search though he tried to recollect	1.8078071332611299
about biscuits he <unk> remembered	1.1945567061358442
who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy	1.4900396695271045
however in another pocket he came across what he <unk> in the dark were pennies erroneously however as it turned out	2.1682533364385472
—those are halfcrowns man corley <unk> him	1.2771109158983913
stephen anyhow lent him one of them	1.3225494840589052
—thanks corley answered you’re a gentleman	1.2027652461568494
i’ll pay you back one time	1.2005956778850755
who’s that with you	1.1539110340423995
i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan the billsticker	1.900601319282192
you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there	1.9699785566265906
i’d carry a <unk> only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks man	1.762885143569003
god you’ve to book ahead man you’d think it was for the <unk> rosa	1.9927886951554015
i don’t give a shite anyway so long as i get a job even as a crossing sweeper	1.8456437920021154
subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags <unk> that he said stephen knew well out of <unk> the <unk> <unk> there that used to be often round in nagle’s back with <unk> and a little chap with a <unk> the name of <unk>	1.7301957388458942
anyhow he was lagged the night before last and <unk> ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable	1.675792738418475
mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation <unk> sentrybox who evidently a <unk> for work it struck him was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept	1.825667791303485
he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephen’s anything but <unk> <unk> interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the <unk> idea when	2.085205857248754
being a <unk> individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very <unk> hat and <unk> wearing apparel generally <unk> to a chronic <unk>	1.7970771529118306
palpably he was one of his <unk> but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one <unk> on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal <unk> with or without the option of a fine would be a very <unk> avis altogether	1.6050163175336876
in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning	2.0673112699192737
pretty thick that was certainly	1.2087759589369365
the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who with his practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the <unk> of the other <unk>	2.499957616757044
alluding to the encounter he said <unk> stephen that is —he is down on his luck	1.874306892418205
he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichman	1.9054914367426197
at this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest mr bloom gazed <unk> for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a <unk> <unk> in the farfamed name of eblana moored <unk> customhouse quay and quite possibly out of <unk> <unk> he observed <unk> <unk> gets their own ration of luck they say	1.7782794100389228
but leaving that for the moment how much did you part with he queried if i am not too <unk>	2.0145411604146033
—half a crown stephen responded	1.1901120750583125
i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere	1.3171904959858503
mr bloom ejaculated <unk> not the least surprise at the intelligence i can quite credit the <unk> and i guarantee he invariably does	1.9942405652286659
everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds	1.473009421695202
walking to sandycove is out of the question	2.0647895210778437
and even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at westland row station	1.5759821158147245
simply fag out there for nothing	1.2939603405329358
i don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the <unk> degree but why did you leave your father’s house	2.0659125975862356
—to seek misfortune was stephen’s answer	1.1823389857503317
—i met your respected father on a recent occasion mr bloom <unk> returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on yesterday	1.5562837458700003
where does he live at present	1.355215743034145
i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved	2.112485947166671
—i believe he is in dublin somewhere stephen answered <unk>	1.5102050185312204
—a <unk> man mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior in more respects than one and a born <unk> if ever there was one	1.8033502986931813
he takes great pride quite legitimate out of you	1.2367780614559196
you could go back perhaps he <unk> still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two mulligan that is and that english tourist friend of his who eventually <unk> their third companion were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion which they did	1.6876124757881479
there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however such as it was stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in <unk> his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak <unk> shell cocoa that was in the <unk> kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the <unk> for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy boody and katey the cat meanwhile under the <unk> <unk> a mess of <unk> and <unk> fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third <unk> of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it being quarter tense or if not <unk> days or something like that	1.2689610031679222
—no mr bloom repeated again i wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who <unk> the humorous element dr mulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes	1.5946902575880226
he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals	1.6694426864519238
of course you didn’t notice as much as i did	1.744160938088237
but it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object	1.5955522586566762
he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a <unk> <unk> man by no means confined to medicine only who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was <unk> bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at <unk> or malahide was it	1.4556047973707602
was he was bound to admit an exceedingly <unk> deed which he could not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer <unk> or jealousy pure and simple	1.721888617078803
<unk> it simply <unk> to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains he ventured to throw out	1.991363106224057
the <unk> glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly <unk> to judge by two or three <unk> remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less	1.5160826983319609
grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet	1.4420128907978336
adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably <unk> in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their <unk> language in a particularly animated way there being some little differences between the parties	1.5659714360001926
— <unk> madonna che ci dia i <unk>	1.1484064600316382
<unk> la <unk> più	1.3792324502660345
mr bloom and stephen entered the cabman’s shelter an <unk> wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been before the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skin the goat fitzharris the invincible though he could not <unk> for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in	1.6265507027536246
a few moments later saw our two <unk> safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript <unk> of the genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking <unk> by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity	1.6234894179331514
—now touching a cup of coffee mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice it <unk> to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food say a roll of some description	1.876279744681531
accordingly his first act was with characteristic <unk> to order these commodities quietly	1.346300620560993
the hoi polloi of jarvies or <unk> or whatever they were after a <unk> examination turned their eyes apparently <unk> away though one redbearded <unk> individual portion of whose hair was greyish a sailor probably still stared for some <unk> time before <unk> his rapt attention to the floor	1.6230870449177266
mr bloom <unk> himself of the right of free speech he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in <unk> though to be sure rather in a quandary over voglio remarked to his <unk> in an audible tone of voice à propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious —a beautiful language	1.7782794100389228
i mean for singing purposes	1.162183107864578
why do you not write your poetry in that language	1.6239542166907301
it is so melodious and full	1.4162757681764493
stephen who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could suffering from <unk> generally replied —to fill the ear of a cow elephant	1.5574341500455895
they were <unk> over money	1.9100043800683013
of course he <unk> <unk> at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary it may be only the southern <unk> that <unk> it	2.5947002685832032
the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête à tête put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed	1.7805555662682546
after which he beat a retreat to his counter mr bloom <unk> to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to	2.1854739696794567
for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by <unk> pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him	1.7156360395298695
<unk> are <unk> stephen said after a pause of some little time like names	1.992480473820965
cicero <unk> napoleon mr <unk>	1.097917375153488
<unk> were as common as <unk>	1.1743062590710658
what’s in a name	1.0738728270091242
—yes to be sure mr bloom <unk> concurred	2.3216130521840377
our name was changed too he added pushing the socalled roll across	1.334133987492504
the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the <unk> <unk> stephen whom he had <unk> out for attention in particular <unk> by asking —and what might your name be	2.2305795568613895
just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion’s boot but stephen apparently <unk> the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter answered —dedalus	1.4684464234017238
the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy <unk> eyes rather bunged up from excessive use of boose preferably good old <unk> and water	1.754620019026096
—you know simon dedalus	1.0482940427677603
he asked at length	1.0744966639588585
<unk> heard of him stephen said	1.4630003271578726
mr bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too	1.9056420120093016
—he’s irish the <unk> bold affirmed staring still in much the same way and nodding	1.5600843354153826
—all too irish stephen rejoined	1.1202664456224407
as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark —i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder	1.8329807108324359
the <unk> dead shot	1.1239303218618601
though he was slightly <unk> by an occasional <unk> and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain	2.064748121797136
<unk> out there say	1.1704980826528453
eggs on the bottles	1.1889028590913853
cocks his gun over his shoulder	1.2242302988319524
he turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely	1.7372558266627336
he then shouted once	1.0674208874928826
the entire audience waited anticipating an additional <unk> there being still a further egg	1.4126896308834795
egg two evidently demolished he nodded and winked adding <unk> <unk> bill shoots to kill never missed nor he never will	1.3172277166910538
a silence ensued till mr bloom for <unk> sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a <unk> competition like the <unk>	1.8177339120422555
—beg pardon the sailor said	1.1818747387361717
mr bloom pursued without flinching a <unk>	1.1475075923847944
he <unk> the wide world with hengler’s royal circus	1.8959310122144855

she’s my own true wife i haven’t seen for seven years now sailing about	1.381805829633704
mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene the <unk> to the mariner’s roadside <unk> after having <unk> davy jones a rainy night with a blind moon	1.8541688980240918
across the world for a wife	1.4147210201719242
quite a number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic <unk> arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember <unk> o’leary a favourite and most trying <unk> piece by the way of poor john <unk> and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way	1.8798763360114141

i remain with much love your <unk> husband w	1.342229132722254
the sailor who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident turned to one of the jarvies with the request —you don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare <unk> about you	1.8794956873627584
the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand	1.5327732270702237
—thank you the sailor said	1.2771190287275083
he deposited the quid in his gob and chewing and with some slow stammers proceeded —we come up this morning eleven o’clock	1.4506177346899607

in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very <unk> folded document	1.5225537526304187
—you must have seen a fair share of the world the keeper remarked leaning on the counter	1.857559250156158
i was in the red sea	2.5905346081711946

—you seen queer sights don’t be talking put in a jarvey	1.5724016448771976

i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid	1.4256573496942344
he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and lodging it between his teeth bit ferociously <unk>	1.9386327114357778
a friend of mine sent me	1.676893631905872
he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table	1.7608829785673277

mr bloom without <unk> surprise <unk> turned over the card to <unk> the partially obliterated address and <unk>	1.8256533075557508
it ran as follows <unk> postal señor a boudin <unk> <unk> <unk> chile	2.2816654276358768
there was no message evidently as he took particular notice	1.902564930480639
though not an <unk> believer in the lurid story narrated or the <unk> <unk> for that matter despite william tell and the <unk> don <unk> de <unk> incident depicted in maritana on which occasion the <unk> ball passed through the <unk> hat having detected a <unk> between his name assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having <unk> the compass on the strict q	1.5947870582948211
somewhere and the <unk> addressee of the <unk> which made him <unk> some <unk> of our friend’s bona <unk> nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a <unk> plan he meant to one day <unk> some <unk> or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled <unk> to any great extent but he was at heart a born <unk> though by a trick of fate he had <unk> remained a <unk> except you call going to holyhead which was his longest martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but some deuced <unk> or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through	1.3367506999197079
but even suppose it did come to <unk> down the needful and breaking boyd’s heart it was not so dear purse <unk> a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to mullingar where he <unk> on going was five and six there and back	1.7201786693809846
the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing <unk> and be in every way thoroughly <unk> especially for a chap whose liver was out of order seeing the different places along the route <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower abbey wealth of park lane to <unk> acquaintance with	1.566048452832833

no something top <unk> an all star irish caste the tweedy flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of <unk> to the elster grimes and moody manners perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of <unk> who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure	1.5947870582948211
that was the rub	2.320583095678176
also without being actually positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new <unk> to keep pace with the times apropos of the <unk> <unk> route which it was mooted was once more on the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> with the usual quantity of red tape and <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> generally	1.701254279852589
a great opportunity there certainly was for push and <unk> to meet the travelling needs of the public at large the average man ie brown robinson and co it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street when the system really needed <unk> up for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was <unk> from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever <unk> up since my old stick in the mud took me for a wife	1.3938972755249328
after all hang it they had their eleven and more <unk> months of it and <unk> a <unk> change of venue after the grind of city life in the <unk> for choice when dame nature is at her <unk> best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life	2.023589647725157
there were equally excellent opportunities for <unk> in the home island delightful <unk> spots for rejuvenation offering a <unk> of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque <unk> even poulaphouca to which there was a <unk> but also farther away from the <unk> crowd in wicklow <unk> <unk> the garden of ireland an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down and in the wilds of donegal where if report spoke true the coup <unk> was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily <unk> so that the <unk> of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic <unk> and otherwise silken thomas grace <unk> george <unk> rhododendrons several hundred feet above <unk> was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally usually by the way on their left leg it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar	1.1874815363065987
because of course <unk> tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired	1.6238247632495026
interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity pure and simple was whether it was the traffic that created the route or <unk> or the two sides in fact	1.9694354148762998
he turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to stephen	1.8829889947874094
—i seen a chinese one time related the doughty narrator that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different	1.6779235273049387
cooks rats in your soup he <unk> added the <unk> does	1.3808977614973572
possibly perceiving an expression of <unk> on their faces the <unk> went on <unk> to his adventures	2.3653705714819764
—and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap	1.4900725255887992

whilst speaking he produced a <unk> <unk> quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position	2.266352592946407
—in a <unk> it was count of a <unk> between two <unk>	2.660702357409555

—they’re great for the cold steel somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all	1.8410773182925546
and stephen each in his own particular way both instinctively exchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly <unk> nous variety however towards where skin the goat alias the keeper not turning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his <unk> affair	1.5916254325639847
his <unk> face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itself <unk> description conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on	1.6534310678113373
there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause	1.141438119824557
one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with the natives choza de another the <unk> discharge	1.4335680516869835
mr bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood	1.7092554083986413
he <unk> recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles when it took the <unk> world by storm <unk> speaking early in the <unk> eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteen	1.968419447286612
—ay boss the sailor broke in	1.212034003400283
give us back them papers	1.1618862254598008
—have you seen the rock of gibraltar	1.2534033483468203
the sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ay or no	1.7240059913992396
—ah you’ve touched there too mr bloom said europa point thinking he had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so simply letting <unk> a jet of <unk> into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn	1.9628295508701126
can you recall the boats	1.1507901710566877
our soi disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering —i’m tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships	1.6979288218231612
salt <unk> all the time	1.535780853530326
tired seemingly he ceased	1.074494486062864
his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a <unk> old <unk> fell to <unk> on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three <unk> of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves	1.6744824380115346
on more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite <unk> at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings	1.631083381201019
and it left him wondering why	1.1993427244716999
possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up and down the <unk> and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under tempting the <unk>	2.201880020996101
and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all	1.4795095885025311
nevertheless without going into the minutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of <unk> on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on <unk> the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter where living inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to them like that should <unk> its gratitude also to the <unk> and <unk> service who had to man the <unk> and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights kish and others liable to <unk> at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably <unk> not to say stormy weather	1.1835067295194688
—there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover the old <unk> himself a rover proceeded went <unk> and took up a soft job as gentleman’s <unk> at six quid a month	1.9662517970539526
them are his trousers i’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that <unk>	1.800821195799364
i’m game for that job shaving and brushup	1.3032126176181018
i hate roaming about	1.0210788231065273
there’s my son now danny run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in cork where he could be drawing easy money	1.509047916247947
—what age is he	1.066257391963021
queried one <unk> who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell the townclerk away from the <unk> cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of <unk> about the nasal <unk>	2.154434690031884
—why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son danny	1.6657390328519597
he’d be about eighteen now way i figure it	1.2787262395621497
the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image <unk> in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor	1.6828562746205655
—there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts	1.2934951535379744
it’s them black lads i objects to	1.1477872572724415
i hate those <unk>	1.320841230672149
suck your blood dry they does	1.1497624401837057
seeing they were all looking at his chest he <unk> dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUMBER> and a young man’s sideface looking <unk> rather	1.8494021701396297
<unk> the <unk> explained	3.6208517522596955
that was done when we were lying becalmed off <unk> in the black sea under captain dalton	2.5586659196193398
fellow the name of antonio done that	1.8141901847415836
there he is himself a greek	2.0705360475232086
—did it hurt much doing it	1.1440002714126984
one asked the sailor	1.1654154928069922
that worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round the	1.3017658298197758
—see here he said showing antonio	1.4257145780398277
there he is cursing the mate	1.7811804645985205
and there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special <unk> evidently and he laughing at a <unk>	1.7838340727411868
and in point of fact the young man named <unk> livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the <unk> admiration of everybody including skin the goat who this time stretched over	1.5778072323610586
—ay ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest he’s gone too	1.5977194709260545
ate by sharks after	1.052015200871746
he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before	1.53376942112844
<unk> bit of work one <unk> said	1.2896036095270964
—and what’s the number for	1.267884452903942
loafer number two queried	1.124461390476065
—ay ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number	1.7766190672319384
a greek he was	1.1137521686650274
and then he added with rather <unk> humour considering his alleged end —as bad as old antonio for he left me on my ownio	1.6372231085525004
the face of a <unk> glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably <unk> on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill	2.1844454258551997
mr bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment <unk> but <unk> calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink	1.8509913780649274
his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay the partially <unk> female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you mrs b	1.7972943854357073
also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing	1.2756571850043827
still candour <unk> him to admit he had washed his wife’s <unk> when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with <unk> and draper’s <unk> ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt	1.735236061073083
still just then being on <unk> he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off	1.528323435901106
round the side of the evening telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented <unk> grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of <unk> round skipper murphy’s <unk> chest and then there was no more of her	1.8139306939110624
—the <unk> the keeper said	1.3439382744096329
—it beats me mr bloom confided to stephen medically i am speaking how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if he values his health in the least unfortunate creature	1.708663743620928
still no matter what the cause is from	1.4479151393952319
stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking —in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade	1.4534926548771963
fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul	1.4190267139202544
she is a bad merchant	1.6010584796590688
she buys dear and sells cheap	1.198732724806065
the elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a <unk> said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to <unk> to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any <unk> <unk> on the subject a necessary evil were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a <unk> was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start	1.5160826983319609
whoever <unk> on a policy of the sort he said and <unk> the matter thoroughly would <unk> a <unk> boon on everybody concerned	2.5721780283671873
—you as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul	1.5353089195577487
or do you mean the intelligence the <unk> as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup	1.93933488206478
i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter	1.6935465394743972
otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays for instance	1.441318319626841
thus cornered stephen had to make a <unk> effort of memory to try and <unk> and remember before he could say —they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible	2.099582842002863
it would be immortal i understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who from all i can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes corruptio per se and corruptio per <unk> both being excluded by court etiquette	1.7104180770620148
i shouldn’t think that is the proper word	1.761705399845153
of course i grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon	1.543941110156817
but what i am <unk> to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like <unk> though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man i mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a <unk> natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god	1.5753186734235158
—o that stephen <unk> has been proved conclusively by several of the <unk> passages in holy writ apart from circumstantial evidence	1.7587531621204056
on this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages <unk>	1.5145356649196304
the more experienced of the two <unk> sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief	1.768151913799583
i’m not so sure about that	1.2014292699070706
that’s a matter for <unk> opinion and without dragging in the <unk> side of the business i beg to <unk> with you in <unk> there	2.482124361974152
my belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine <unk> all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like hamlet and bacon as you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i of course i needn’t tell you	1.6190179450586948
can’t you drink that coffee by the way	1.2500193021899433
let me stir it	1.0586787192860654
and take a piece of that bun	1.9165770434416816
it’s like one of our <unk> bricks disguised	1.6599615987015686
still no one can give what he hasn’t got	1.490166801891263
<unk> stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further	1.7225660161244727
<unk> being a <unk> bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching <unk> on the coffee palace and its temperance and <unk> work	1.7591038352975874
to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good <unk> such as the present one they were in run on <unk> lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful <unk> admittance free by <unk> men for the lower orders	1.7853863825107739
on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest <unk> indeed for her <unk>	1.866143746783175
the idea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak of	1.5073703278978516
<unk> of copper poison so <NUMBER> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap <unk> somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where	1.6969525137262096
anyhow inspection medical inspection of all <unk> seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr <unk> <unk> cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved	1.740149535650771
—have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being <unk>	1.6644945538349065
thus <unk> on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown <unk> it <unk> out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the <unk> beverage	2.233970588270614
—still it’s solid food his good genius urged i’m a <unk> for solid food his one and only reason being not <unk> in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manual	1.9193033421469496
you ought to eat more solid food	1.7271650052163765
you would feel a different man	1.3342542150154257
<unk> i can eat stephen said	1.4053812527325995
but o oblige me by taking away that knife	1.311308616704277
i can’t look at the point of it	2.0717893267078593
it reminds me of roman history	1.5606700158314637
mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the <unk> article a blunt <unk> ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it	1.4755728590947164
—our mutual friend’s stories are like himself mr bloom apropos of knives remarked to his <unk> <unk> voce	1.7451748680877983
do you think they are genuine	1.8631152203645638
he could spin those <unk> for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots	1.4352093906465315
yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the <unk> he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel	1.701254279852589
though a <unk> man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to <unk> there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to <unk> such a <unk> specimen with the <unk> and <unk> fraternity	2.023589647725157
he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in <unk> vile to say nothing of the antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who <unk> his crimes in the <unk> manner above described	1.5848931924611136
on the other hand he might be only <unk> a <unk> weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs dublin <unk> like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner <unk> and etcetera	1.6972449585834108
and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a <unk> candle to the wholesale <unk> other fellows coined about him	1.5029331575414253
—mind you i’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention he resumed	1.5100241264694412
<unk> scenes are occasionally if not often met with	1.3002842002357045
giants though that is rather a far cry you see once in a way <unk> the <unk> queen	2.1052825604409033
in those <unk> in henry street i myself saw some <unk> as they are called sitting <unk> they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee were utterly <unk> from sitting that way so long cramped up being adored as gods	1.6377587393442954

however reverting to friend sinbad and his <unk> adventures who reminded him a bit of ludwig alias <unk> when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was <unk> with the <unk> in the flying dutchman a <unk> success and his host of admirers came in large numbers everyone simply <unk> to hear him though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing <unk> <unk> about it he <unk>	1.4942339672143998
on the contrary that <unk> in the back touch was quite in keeping with those <unk> though candidly he was none the less free to admit those <unk> and <unk> in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober <unk> hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to <unk> the harmless necessary animal of the <unk> persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent <unk> with garlic de <unk> off him or her next day on the quiet and he added on the cheap	1.3894954943731377

rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a <unk> of mine but still it’s a thing i simply hate to see	2.187567705851896
interest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog <unk> with icebergs all that sort of thing	1.6501808641213838
<unk> of course had his own say to say	1.789242729666957
so then after that they <unk> on to the wreck off <unk> rock wreck of that <unk> norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell remembered it palme on booterstown strand	1.7712240667466705

it having become necessary for him to <unk> a reef the sailor vacated his seat	1.9096879713767025
—let me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze	1.6873302950533235
he made tracks heavily slowly with a <unk> sort of a gait to the door stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left	2.312979068257914
while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two <unk> of presumably <unk> rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior saw him produce a bottle and <unk> it or <unk> and <unk> its nozzle to his lips take a good old <unk> swig out of it with a gurgling noise	1.6265507027536246
the <unk> bloom who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a <unk> after the <unk> in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by his rum <unk> <unk> gaping up at the piers and <unk> of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved	1.53174046370208

and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town <unk> pink without a <unk> <unk>	1.9793837173478845
he drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business <unk> big if <unk> had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality	1.671043473520484

right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called	1.2798294720945254
there were <unk> and wreckers the keeper said who was evidently au <unk>	2.417255608199116
what he wanted to <unk> was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr <unk> or some name like that eh	1.7113300613656424

anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation cum potation <unk> an atmosphere of drink into the <unk> <unk> trolling like a veritable son of a <unk> —the biscuits was as hard as brass and the beef as salt as <unk> wife’s arse	1.9168981897285966
after which effusion the <unk> specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided	1.6818016266882532
skin the goat assuming he was he evidently with an <unk> to grind was airing his <unk> in a <unk> feeble <unk> anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy <unk> as the <unk> country bar none on the face of god’s earth far and away superior to england with coal in large <unk> six million pounds worth of pork exported every year ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england <unk> taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more <unk> steam in the same vein	1.3367506999197079
their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact	1.8221065521860482
you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil he stated and there was that colonel <unk> down there in <unk> growing tobacco where would you find anywhere the like of irish bacon	1.849999370915438
but a day of reckoning he stated <unk> with no uncertain voice thoroughly <unk> all the conversation was in store for mighty england despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes	1.7207535758920522
the germans and the <unk> were going to have their little <unk> he affirmed	2.804777213519934
the boers were the beginning of the end	1.399342119947361
<unk> england was toppling already and her downfall would be ireland her achilles heel which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles the greek hero a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the <unk> referred to on his boot	1.426005566558394
his advice to every irishman was stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland	1.6590811977966997
ireland parnell said could not spare a single one of her sons	1.447416881283734
silence all round marked the termination of his <unk>	1.3560883728717892
the impervious <unk> heard these lurid tidings <unk>	1.2254357913847616
—take a bit of doing boss retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit <unk> in response to the <unk> <unk>	1.8755252396041524
to which cold <unk> <unk> to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view	1.7825881086019595
—who’s the best troops in the army	1.39958246083772
the grizzled old veteran <unk> interrogated	1.4016954583124412
and the best <unk> and <unk>	1.7516418827561067
and the best <unk> and generals <unk> got	1.7079492826015403
—the irish for choice retorted the cabby like campbell facial <unk> apart	1.2311160926679818
—that’s right the old tarpaulin <unk>	1.3660352628448744

you know jem <unk>	0.9950676550442253
while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire ours or his and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it	1.3984523911996007
then they began to have a few <unk> words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in <unk> and come to blows	1.9896051386068598
from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to <unk> the suggestion as <unk> <unk> for <unk> that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for he was fully <unk> of the fact that their neighbours across the channel unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealed their strength than the opposite	1.701254279852589
it was quite on a par with the <unk> idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies equally <unk> to the issue might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart	1.474142020110622
another little interesting point the amours of whores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her more so in fact	1.7892498797511704
so the scene between the pair of them the <unk> of the place <unk> to be or have been fitzharris the famous invincible and the other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the <unk> a student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the game	1.715437896342879
and as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasn’t the other person at all he b	1.6522414340908143
couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the <unk> unless you were a <unk> idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their <unk> there always being the <unk> of a <unk> coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like denis or peter carey an idea he utterly repudiated	1.6496480740980204
quite apart from that he disliked those careers of <unk> and crime on principle	1.9269539761502443
yet though such criminal <unk> had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually <unk> a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictions though personally he would never be a party to any such thing off the same bat as those love <unk> of the south have her or swing for her when the husband frequently after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an <unk> <unk> <unk> by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that <unk> <unk> skin the goat merely drove the car for the actual <unk> of the outrage and so was not if he was <unk> informed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on	1.2102439719957476
in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend the <unk> skin the etcetera he had <unk> outlived his welcome	1.9088670744304361
he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high	1.8638720001662892
like actresses always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again	1.3261764958188598
generous to a fault of course <unk> no <unk> or any idea of the sort always <unk> at the bone for the shadow	2.1158208115802153
so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some £	1.7246928066292269
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the <unk> atmosphere of the old ireland tavern come back to erin and so on	2.1204281830386664
then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually <unk> the <unk>	1.8001875154891216
—he took <unk> at something or other that <unk> but on the whole <unk> person declared i let slip	1.819165191240796
he called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively	2.0584347114158468
so i without <unk> from plain facts in the least told him his god i mean christ was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality i’m not	1.7830657640531808
that was one for him	1.5431851077632959
a soft answer turns away wrath	1.1518723147754932
am i not right	1.349729241879716
he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of <unk> dark pride at the soft <unk> with a glance also of <unk> for he seemed to <unk> in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly	2.2842691444112506
— ex <unk> stephen mumbled in a <unk> accent their two or four eyes <unk> <unk> or bloom his name is or after all any other secundum <unk>	1.9782333855727372
—of course mr b	1.0743047685166067
proceeded to <unk> you must look at both sides of the question	1.7799095965023561
it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country they say our own <unk> included has the government it deserves	1.5080007176171728
but with a little <unk> all round	1.9129631615141853
it’s all very fine to boast of mutual <unk> but what about mutual equality	1.519608550195644
i <unk> violence and <unk> in any shape or form	1.714300201650803
it never reaches anything or stops anything	1.1638878570296234
a revolution must come on the due instalments plan	1.3166465069064213
it’s a patent <unk> on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another <unk> in the next house so to speak	2.458447039698774
<unk> bloody bridge battle and seven <unk> war stephen assented between skinner’s alley and ormond market	1.2768732820117161
yes mr bloom thoroughly agreed entirely <unk> the remark that was <unk> right	1.7657965398549569
and the whole world was full of that sort of thing	1.971361230249024
—you just took the words out of my mouth he said	1.713042375190926
a <unk> of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t <unk>	1.949701543427287
all those wretched <unk> in his humble opinion stirring up bad blood from some bump of <unk> or gland of some kind erroneously supposed to be about a <unk> of honour and a flag were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything greed and jealousy people never knowing when to stop	1.79571449437164
—they accuse remarked he <unk>	1.089149256812596
he turned away from the others who <unk> and spoke nearer to so as the <unk> in case <unk> <unk> he softly imparted in an aside in stephen’s ear are accused of ruining	2.2710450286776895
not a vestige of truth in it i can safely say	1.7049790599899703
history would you be surprised to learn proves up to the hilt spain <unk> when the inquisition <unk> the jews out and england <unk> when cromwell an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for <unk> them	1.627415510319261
because they are <unk> with the proper spirit	2.527809956729368
they are practical and are proved to be so	1.268769415442825
i don’t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are	1.8220289684442665
but in the economic not touching religion domain the priest spells poverty	1.5029770956386546
spain again you saw in the war compared with goahead america	1.344920820342672
it’s in the dogma	1.413843863234024
because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better at least so i think	1.528698021566844
’s raise the wind on false pretences	1.3342633489428697
that’s the vital issue at stake and it’s <unk> and would be provocative of <unk> intercourse between man and man	1.429621373361818
at least that’s my idea for what it’s worth	1.342800928021635
i call that patriotism	1.1611564099617981
ubi <unk> as we learned a <unk> of in our classical days in <unk> mater vita <unk>	1.8451099754919331
where you can live well the sense is if you work	1.5163275274063408
he could hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those <unk> about ringsend in the morning <unk> quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to	1.891315191571344
then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said if you work	1.7382952981568427
<unk> me out he managed to remark meaning work	1.3062308734124175
the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the person who owned them pro <unk>	1.4461124243470782
observed or rather his voice speaking did all must work have to together	1.3923261293915394
—i mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widest possible sense	1.7646164289615527
also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing	1.2351109131600044
writing for the <unk> which is the readiest channel nowadays	2.739059249767261
after all from the little i know of you after all the money <unk> on your education you are entitled to <unk> yourself and command your price	1.6645050384307516
you have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has	1.4337009319235827
you both belong to ireland the brain and the brawn	1.322861915987401
each is equally important	1.0690137379919593
—you suspect stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that i may be important because i belong to the <unk> saint patrice called ireland for short	1.9948193583061178
—i would go a step farther mr bloom <unk>	1.4396296695138942
—but i suspect stephen interrupted that ireland must be important because it belongs to me	1.3685823914532904
—what belongs queried mr bloom bending <unk> he was perhaps under some misapprehension	1.6436975753073009
what was it you	1.7849322599733695
stephen patently <unk> repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding —we can’t change the country	1.435943411551208
let us change the subject	1.1238736078270402
at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom to change the subject looked down but in a quandary as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry	1.6321639443706233
the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part	1.584977745646044
needless to say the fumes of his recent <unk> spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state	1.5830596703850328
probably the <unk> to which mr b attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people	1.8783026726598202
with a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he <unk> <unk> with an air of some <unk> remembering he had just come back from paris the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light on the subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so <unk> nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves	1.5947870582948211
for instance there was the case of o’callaghan for one the <unk> <unk> respectably connected though of inadequate means with his mad <unk> among whose other gay <unk> when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact	1.8529220216409523
and then the usual dénouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be <unk> away by a few friends after a strong hint to a blind horse from john <unk> of lower castle yard so as not to be made <unk> under section two of the criminal law <unk> act certain names of those <unk> being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains	1.5085907086001784
briefly putting two and two together six sixteen which he <unk> turned a deaf ear to antonio and so forth jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the <unk> or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne then heir apparent the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state he reflected about the errors of <unk> and crowned heads running counter to <unk> such as the <unk> case a number of years before under their <unk> in a way scarcely intended by nature a thing good mrs <unk> as the law stands was <unk> down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always <unk> more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it	1.2376350284724815
ladies who like distinctive underclothing should and every <unk> man must trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine <unk> to acts of <unk> between the two she unbuttoned his and then he untied her mind the pin whereas <unk> in the <unk> islands say at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental	1.7301957388458942
however reverting to the original there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their <unk>	1.867116788884732
sheer force of natural genius that	1.1805770846097023
for which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the <unk> occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it	1.8720895435747178
still to <unk> the acquaintance of someone of no <unk> calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply <unk> any small	1.5998407751383545
intellectual stimulation as such was he felt from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind	1.5179005500528855

all the same bloom properly so <unk> was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years	1.8473452468207374
highly <unk> of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and even supposing he thought a return highly <unk> all things considered	1.8144838638333871
something evidently riled them in his death	1.4273279301269604
either he <unk> out too tamely of acute <unk> just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were <unk> to find the job was taken out of their hands	1.4806572771858608
of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the alice where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several <unk> such as fox and stewart so the remark which <unk> from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility	1.5356887156508858
naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet whereas messrs so and so who though they weren’t even a patch on the former man <unk> the roost after their <unk> features were very few and far between	1.6559453978595828

to show the <unk> in the title <unk> how to	2.4801259014635457
he saw him once on the <unk> occasion when they broke up the type in the insuppressible or was it united ireland a privilege he keenly appreciated and in point of fact handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said thank you excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip what’s bred in the bone	1.615598098439874
still as regards return	1.1183849316262573
you were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got back	1.6037687529214315
then a lot of <unk> usually followed tom for and dick and harry against and then number one you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your <unk> like the <unk> in the tichborne case roger charles tichborne bella was the <unk> name to the best of his recollection he the heir went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in indian ink lord <unk> was it as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then when got up to tally with the description given introduce himself with excuse me my name is so and so or some such <unk> remark	1.3272441495835603
a more prudent course as bloom said to the not over effusive in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him would have been to sound the lie of the land first —that bitch that english whore did for him the shebeen proprietor commented	1.6927971621525453

this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character <unk> a fair amount of laughter among his entourage	1.3877534879722468
as regards bloom he without the faintest suspicion of a smile merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had <unk> extraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet <unk>	1.7259805536966004
first it was strictly platonic till nature <unk> and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a <unk> and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few <unk> however who were resolved upon <unk> his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the <unk> extent that it subsequently <unk> into	1.5753186734235158
since their names were coupled though since he was her declared favourite where was the particular necessity to <unk> it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally <unk> everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of <unk> out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel having gained admittance in the same fashion a fact the <unk> addicted to the <unk> a little simply coined shoals of money out of	1.3468224433499252
whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man <unk> on the scene strong to the verge of weakness falling a victim to her <unk> charms and forgetting home ties the usual <unk> to <unk> in the loved <unk> smiles	1.6744824380115346
the eternal question of the life connubial needless to say cropped up	1.6246493522328938
can real love supposing there happens to be another chap in the case exist between married folk	1.6602503184969681
a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary that is who was just the usual everyday farewell my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light <unk> the th hussars to be accurate and inflammable doubtless the fallen leader that is not the other in his own <unk> way which she of course woman quickly perceived as highly likely to <unk> his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole his erstwhile staunch <unk> and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the <unk> on their behalf in a way that <unk> their most sanguine <unk> very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose thereby <unk> coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled <unk> kick	1.236017272819744
looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream	1.892424089177461
and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times	1.5277309467184954
why as he reflected irishtown strand a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since as it happened he went to <unk> on the north side	2.060952124878677
north or south however it was just the wellknown case of hot passion pure and simple <unk> the <unk> with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so types that wouldn’t do things by halves passionate <unk> of the south casting every <unk> of decency to the winds	1.7782794100389228
—just bears out what i was saying he with glowing bosom said to stephen about blood and the sun	1.696381441326136
and if i don’t greatly mistake she was spanish too	1.6459582716411185

possible especially there it was as she lived there	1.5112877385642116
carefully avoiding a book in his pocket sweets of which reminded him by the by of that capel street library book out of date he took out his pocketbook and turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he	1.8670401327096868
—do you <unk> by the by he said thoughtfully <unk> a faded photo which he laid on the table that a spanish type	2.141070408794471
stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large <unk> lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of <unk> in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom with more than vision of breasts her full lips parted and some perfect teeth standing near ostensibly with gravity a piano on the rest of which was in old madrid a ballad pretty in its way which was then all the vogue	1.4677992676220695
her the lady’s eyes dark large looked at stephen about to smile about something to be admired lafayette of westmoreland street dublin’s <unk> photographic artist being responsible for the esthetic execution	1.4797887404165722
—mrs bloom my wife the prima donna madam marion tweedy bloom indicated	1.4895488803423615
taken a few years since	1.3886257434362963
very like her then	1.1692238187635264
beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who he intimated was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age <unk> proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen	1.6288348229690572
as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup	2.0910808304852493
she could without difficulty he said have <unk> for the <unk> not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the	2.0230046566306306
he dwelt being a bit of an artist in his spare time on the female form in general <unk> because as it so happened no later than that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues perfectly developed as works of art in the national museum	1.8110275634610504
marble could give the original shoulders back all the symmetry all the rest yes <unk> it does though saint joseph’s sovereign <unk> alors <unk>	1.5384141045335349
whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word	1.4497002729149473
the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack <unk> good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself her stage presence being frankly a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to	1.6480028975648253
but it was scarcely professional etiquette so	1.674629814340106
though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm	1.8443270273526522
and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion	1.737858658164618
nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint	1.387970475736458
in fact the slight <unk> was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled good as new much better in fact with the starch out	1.642335292969736
suppose she was gone when he	1.428215641709338
i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning <unk> bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses <unk> in it which must have fell down sufficiently <unk> beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to <unk> murray	1.6358264997825172
the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished educated <unk> and <unk> into the bargain far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would	2.138855485819594
besides he said the picture was handsome which say what you like it was though at the moment she was distinctly <unk>	1.8392687993852583
an awful lot of <unk> went on about that sort of thing involving a <unk> <unk> with the usual splash page of <unk> about the same old matrimonial tangle <unk> misconduct with professional <unk> or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and <unk> about the whole business	2.023589647725157
how they were <unk> to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and <unk> expressions leaving no <unk> to show that they openly <unk> two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course intimate	1.6265507027536246
then the decree nisi and the king’s <unk> tries to show cause why and he failing to <unk> it nisi was made absolute	1.6707183606259963
but as for that the two <unk> wrapped up as they largely were in one another could safely afford to <unk> it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party <unk> in due course	1.8296743389303036
he b enjoyed the distinction of being close to erin’s <unk> king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic <unk> when the fallen leader’s who <unk> stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery leader’s trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the <unk> works of the insuppressible or no it was united ireland a by no means by the by appropriate <unk> and broke up the <unk> with <unk> or something like that all on account of some <unk> effusions from the <unk> pens of the <unk> <unk> at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals	1.324192791886045
though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the <unk> till they discovered to their vast <unk> that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a <unk> which she however was the first to perceive	1.79571449437164
as those were particularly hot times in the general <unk> bloom sustained a minor <unk> from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course <unk> lodging some place about the pit of the stomach fortunately not of a grave character	1.737755788140435
his hat <unk> a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and as a matter of strict history bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost <unk> who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else what’s bred in the bone <unk> into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect <unk> saying thank you sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day history repeating itself with a difference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave	1.1835067295194688
on the other hand what <unk> him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing <unk> pretending to understand everything the why and the wherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging <unk> of her lord and master upon her knees and <unk> to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the <unk> husband would <unk> the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others	1.2141425040375704
he personally being of a <unk> bias believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when <unk> her duties she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent the <unk> being that her affections <unk> on another the cause of many <unk> between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famous cases of feminine <unk> proved up to the hilt	1.301678755323262
it was a thousand <unk> a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time with <unk> women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime	1.7160107512938323
in the nature of single <unk> he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a <unk> sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson who was very possibly the particular <unk> who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction <unk> in the boy and girl <unk> idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names <unk> or <unk> with the orthodox preliminary canter of <unk> and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and <unk>	1.324192791886045
to think of him house and <unk> <unk> by some landlady worse than any <unk> was really too bad at his age	2.2782699102563644
the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something <unk> he certainly ought to eat even were it only an <unk> made on <unk> maternal nutriment or failing that the homely <unk> <unk> boiled	1.5907294295187053

—the day before yesterday stephen said <unk> on himself	1.8151034906351695
literally <unk> at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected	1.5766099134845533
though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the one train of thought	1.6235074484634333
at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a <unk> <unk> to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in <unk> which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a <unk> regard for those same ultra ideas	1.9429496147158305
for instance when the evicted tenants question then at its first <unk> <unk> largely in people’s mind though it goes without saying not <unk> a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its <unk> some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as <unk> the <unk> of modern opinion a partiality however which <unk> his mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was <unk> with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time <unk> as a <unk> which was one reason he strongly <unk> the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the <unk> in barney kiernan’s so that he though often considerably misunderstood and the least <unk> of mortals be it repeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from <unk> and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it <unk> as a <unk> conclusion on fine young fellows chiefly destruction of the fittest in a word	1.181581732618101
anyhow upon weighing up the <unk> and <unk> getting on for one as it was it was high time to be retiring for the night	2.7441530042019093
the <unk> was it was a bit risky to bring him home as <unk> might possibly <unk> somebody having a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he <unk> brought home a dog breed unknown with a lame paw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered having been there so to speak	1.566048452832833
on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives	2.220923138774378
everything pointed to the fact that it <unk> him to <unk> himself to the full of the opportunity all things considered	2.282701636772197
his initial impression was he was a shade <unk> or not over effusive but it grew on him someway	1.8093377016309218
for one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly <unk> him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he did entertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe if found suitable	1.6744824380115346
at all events he wound up by concluding <unk> for the nonce <unk> precedent a cup of epps’s cocoa and a <unk> for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a <unk> he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the <unk> no rumpus of any sort was kicked up	1.539926526059492
a move had to be made because that merry old soul the <unk> in question who appeared to be glued to the spot didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some <unk> bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that <unk> <unk> whereabouts for a few days to come alternately <unk> their feelings the <unk> with <unk> revolver <unk> <unk> on the tropical calculated to freeze the <unk> of anybody’s bones and mauling their <unk> charms <unk> with rough and tumble gusto to the <unk> of large <unk> of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address as mr algebra remarks <unk>	1.2731955290816555
at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle <unk> to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew	1.916367497443599
people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep	1.5197400205268274
the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles	1.221710612874003
your god was a jew	1.1950908072453847
because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from <unk> on shannon or <unk> in the county sligo	2.32630278555386
—i propose our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over	1.4513512833442799
you can’t drink that stuff	1.1556822912006413
do you like cocoa	1.5389323001275523
i’ll just pay this lot	1.11954182858816
the best plan clearly being to clear out the remainder being plain sailing he beckoned while prudently pocketing the photo to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to	1.4209415406510673
—yes that’s the best he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less	1.6930448092113506
all kinds of <unk> plans were flashing through his <unk> busy brain education the genuine article literature journalism prize titbits up to date <unk> concert tours in english watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres turning money away duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck	1.5753186734235158
an opening was all was wanted	1.287672578768305
because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well by the way no harm to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to	1.9952623149688797
the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy earl <unk> had presided at the <unk> association dinner in london somewhere	2.2047046930650662
silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling <unk>	1.301316037543256
to which <unk> piece of intelligence echo answered why	1.5694629615694955
—give us a squint at that literature grandfather the ancient mariner put in <unk> some natural impatience	1.5227780479519386
—and welcome answered the elderly party thus addressed	1.2215956444796845
the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of <unk> goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears	2.0840882913439014
—are you bad in the eyes	1.2283016155133386
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried	1.2429244365170908
—why answered the <unk> with the tartan beard who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way staring out of seagreen <unk> as you might well describe them as i uses goggles reading	2.0698012485269532
the <unk> nights entertainment was my favourite and red as a rose is she	1.382846046420517
hereupon he pawed the journal open and <unk> upon lord only knows what found drowned or the <unk> of king willow <unk> having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for <unk> during which time completely regardless of <unk> the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which <unk> pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions that is to say either simply looking on <unk> or passing a trivial remark	1.4330125702369627
to cut a long story short bloom grasping the situation was the first to rise from his seat so as not to <unk> their welcome having first and foremost being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming making a grand total of fourpence the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers literally the last of the mohicans he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures coffee d <unk> do and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way as wetherup used to remark	1.2891222895981396
—come he counselled to close the <unk>	1.1830283037276879
seeing that the <unk> worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente	1.578753319757741
stephen who confessed to still feeling <unk> and fagged out paused at the for a moment the door	1.5452207897580317
—one thing i never understood he said to be original on the spur of the moment	1.794473901162307
to which impromptu the <unk> bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation saying straight off —to sweep the floor in the morning	1.4893581333723849
so saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right a habit of his by the bye his right side being in classical <unk> his tender achilles	1.6217474748617364
the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins	1.6718401634745612
—it will the air do you good bloom said meaning also the walk in a moment	1.5441009504335488
the only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man	1.3536076378824105
accordingly he passed his left arm in stephen’s right and led him on accordingly	1.629816228989709
—yes stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him <unk> and wobbly and all that	1.7481002368706273
anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones brazier etc where the municipal supernumerary ex gumley was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy as the adage has it dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new	1.4948940163725473
and apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a <unk> to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd <unk> that <unk> at the time of the split and chiefly the <unk> peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their <unk>	1.8329807108324359
so they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for which bloom as a pure <unk> possessed the greatest love as they made tracks arm in arm across beresford place	1.57273710236185
<unk> music though <unk> grand in its way was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first go off but the music of <unk> huguenots <unk> seven last words on the cross and mozart’s twelfth mass he simply <unk> in the gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat	1.6496480740980204
he also yielded to none in his admiration of <unk> stabat mater a work simply <unk> in immortal numbers in which his wife madam marion tweedy made a hit a veritable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other <unk> and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit <unk> church in upper gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with <unk> or <unk> rather	1.5848931924611136
there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally <unk> desire for an encore	2.0554491431902813
on the whole though <unk> preferably light opera of the don giovanni description and martha a gem in its line he had a <unk> though with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn	1.6292049381822116
and talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old <unk> he mentioned par excellence lionel’s air in martha m’appari which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be more accurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips of stephen’s respected father sung to perfection a study of the number in fact which made all the others take a back seat	1.6496480740980204
stephen in reply to a politely put query said he didn’t sing it but launched out into <unk> of shakespeare’s songs at least of in or about that period the <unk> <unk> who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist who anno <unk> <unk> <unk> an instrument he was contemplating <unk> from mr <unk> <unk> whom b	1.8139306939110624
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and <unk> and son with their <unk> and comes <unk> and <unk> william who played the virginals he said in the queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one <unk> who made toys or airs and john bull	1.9187520990478337
on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the <unk> a horse dragging a sweeper <unk> on the <unk> ground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull	1.8126819031406194
he inquired if it was john bull the political <unk> of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as a striking coincidence	1.9667544569730966
by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceiving bloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other’s sleeve gently jocosely remarking —our lives are in peril tonight	1.4174612078080582
beware of the <unk>	1.079988408015132
bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new a different <unk> of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts	1.6496480740980204
but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but as he <unk> reflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up	1.641399274833192
he was just a big nervous foolish <unk> kind of a horse without a second care in the world	2.0578481012015772
but even a dog he reflected take that mongrel in barney kiernan’s of the same size would be a holy horror to face	1.8408826766145303
but it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel ship of the <unk> <unk> grapes into potheen in his hump	2.2573100822739582
nine <unk> of them all could be <unk> or trained nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees	1.8241017606117274
whale with a <unk> hairpin alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster <unk> my eagle eye	1.7512644735079828
these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat <unk> from stephen’s words while the ship of the street was <unk> and stephen went on about the highly interesting old	1.8500310585725763
—what’s this i was saying	1.2815233483430737
my wife he intimated plunging in <unk> res would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind	1.5434671217162401
he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen image of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an <unk> <unk> after as he was perhaps not that way built	1.8958325585899456
still supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected it opened up new <unk> in his mind such as lady <unk> irish industries concert on the preceding monday and aristocracy in general	1.8066221825388908
exquisite variations he was now describing on an air youth here has end by <unk> <unk> <unk> a dutchman of amsterdam where the <unk> come from	2.0248505812803264
even more he liked an old german song of johannes <unk> about the clear sea and the voices of sirens sweet murderers of men which <unk> bloom a bit von <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> die <unk> <unk>	2.0165711530749943
these opening bars he sang and translated <unk>	1.2119808003782777
bloom nodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did	1.5462291128836971
a <unk> beautiful tenor voice like that the <unk> of <unk> which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as <unk> and being able to read music into the bargain command its own price where <unk> were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an <unk> into fashionable houses in the best <unk> quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and <unk> people where with his university degree of b	1.4384498882876628
a huge ad in its way and <unk> bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would <unk> score a distinct success being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other <unk> if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better <unk> his way into their good graces as he a youthful <unk> in society’s <unk> <unk> hardly understood how a little thing like that could <unk> against you	1.5483652565854986
it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him <unk> in their musical and artistic <unk> during the <unk> of the christmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the <unk> of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of which as he happened to know were on <unk> fact without giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he cared to could easily have	1.5160826983319609
added to which of course would be the <unk> emolument by no means to be sneezed at going hand in hand with his <unk> fees	2.2969032297307512
not he <unk> that for the sake of filthy <unk> he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time	1.5852464905122605
but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both <unk> and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a <unk> moment when every little helped	1.5520945682871234
besides though taste <unk> had <unk> to a degree original music like that different from the <unk> rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublin’s musical world after the usual <unk> run of <unk> tenor <unk> <unk> on a confiding public by <unk> st <unk> and <unk> st just and their genus <unk>	1.7615770326037883
yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the <unk> esteem where he could command a stiff figure and <unk> ahead give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house given a <unk> if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs so to speak a big if however with some <unk> of the goahead sort to <unk> the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much <unk> prince of good fellows	1.4077153669117268
and it need not <unk> from the other by one <unk> as being his own master he would have heaps of time to <unk> literature in his spare moments when <unk> of so doing without its <unk> with his vocal career or containing anything <unk> whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone	1.8957356524063758
in fact he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at all	1.9940827490368336
the horse was just then	1.2081005836507257
and later on at a propitious opportunity he <unk> bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to <unk> and even to a slight extent with some hilarious <unk> when not present <unk> him or whatever you like to call it which in bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty <unk> on that side of a person’s character no pun intended	1.5013107289081733
the horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak halted and rearing high a proud <unk> tail added his <unk> by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smoking globes of <unk>	1.7302088547084773

barefaced liar and <unk> like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long

back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im <unk> out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id <unk> him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him <unk> him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that <unk> drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the <unk> yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost <unk> you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the <unk> in his <unk> i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be embraced by one in his <unk> and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some <unk> id like to sip those <unk> green and yellow expensive drinks those <unk> <unk> drink with the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the <unk> talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful <unk> in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that evening in <unk> street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed <unk> if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and <unk> and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had to <unk> my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina <unk> husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called <unk> or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it <unk> the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like <unk> or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if <unk> do him any good i know they were <unk> a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina <unk> housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not <unk> to see her a <unk> that was why we had the <unk> row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was <unk> with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first <unk> he said he was he annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of <unk> things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of <unk> poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUMBER> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a <unk> to her with his <unk> kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course <unk> me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the <unk> i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it <unk> her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt <unk> the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUMBER> for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die <NUMBER> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs <unk> that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the <unk> villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off <unk> wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been <unk> in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUMBER> teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew <unk> every other week such a long one i did i forgot my <unk> gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street <unk> return to mrs marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea <NUMBER> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice <unk> ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after <unk> <unk> of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give <NUMBER> points in <NUMBER> to katty lanner and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the <unk> dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was tasting the butter so i took my time bartell darcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang <unk> ave maria what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his <unk> voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUMBER> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along <unk> square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to <unk> the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those <unk> things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their <unk> even when milly and i were out with him at the open air <unk> that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the <unk> cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the <unk> colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i <unk> and stopped then he <unk> me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my <unk> sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket o maria <unk> he did look a big fool <unk> in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and <unk> of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the <unk> pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what <unk> theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUMBER> big poppies because mine was the th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at <unk> barn i couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all <unk> or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old <unk> goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more <unk> nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the <unk> today i thought it was a <unk> first him sending the port and the peaches first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when i knew his <unk> at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <NUMBER> after <NUMBER> when i saw the <NUMBER> dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i threw the penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty when i was whistling there is a charming girl i love and i hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary the th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the <unk> concert at <unk> <unk> boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take a st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well o i suppose <unk> be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an <unk> man that common <unk> that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him <NUMBER> or <NUMBER> <unk> perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say <unk> with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i sang at where its over a year ago when was it st <unk> hall <unk> st little chits of <unk> they have now singing kathleen kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord roberts when i had the map of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the stabat mater by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man <unk> is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after the war that <unk> and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner <unk> <unk> g th <unk> nd east <unk> <unk> of <unk> fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old <unk> paul and the rest of the other old <unk> go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even <unk> shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la <unk> it was lovely after looking across the bay from algeciras all the lights of the rock like <unk> or those sham battles on the <NUMBER> acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the march past the th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won <unk> his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a <unk> like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and <unk> themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit <unk> of course when i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides <unk> down on me like that all the time with his big <unk> hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his <unk> cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUMBER> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of <unk> tip cursing him to the lowest <unk> that <unk> he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long <unk> over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at <unk> when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and <unk> and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and <unk> were <unk> silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good <unk> for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her <unk> she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of <unk> stockings is <unk> after one days wear i could have brought them back to <unk> this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those <unk> corsets id want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUMBER> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from <unk> was as flat as a <unk> he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of <unk> he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that <unk> any good might <unk> it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or <unk> with some of that opoponax and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot <unk> and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUMBER> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and <unk> up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUMBER> years more i have of life up to <NUMBER> no im what am i at all ill be <NUMBER> in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her <unk> on the <unk> she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty <unk> in <unk> street st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs <unk> the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUMBER> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master <unk> somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her <unk> fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her <unk> as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old <unk> face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page <NUMBER> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers <unk> about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for <unk> when he could have been in mr cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him <unk> there to be the manager he gave me a great <unk> once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old <unk> dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to <unk> and burns as i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking <unk> everything he can <unk> off the shelves into it if i went by his <unk> every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a <unk> standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the <unk> one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were yes i think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty <unk> he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs beaten up with <unk> <unk> them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUMBER> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a <unk> that disgusting cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his <unk> up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the <unk> relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the mens greenhouse near the harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUMBER> of the <NUMBER> wonders of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the <unk> party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery i went into <NUMBER> of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that <NUMBER> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple

writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with <unk> though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a <unk> of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at <NUMBER> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they

when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be <unk> so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that <unk> i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the <unk> with the <unk> i wonder was it her josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls

the night he borrowed the <unk> to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a <unk> childs <unk> didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his <unk> and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn <unk> he was always on for <unk> too when i sang maritana with him at freddy <unk> private opera he had a delicious glorious voice <unk> dearest goodbye sweetheart sweet heart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there

then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present

talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the <unk> from <unk> the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy <unk> ad and <unk> ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand <unk> from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too in <NUMBER> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like <unk> or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of washing it from <NUMBER> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the st thing in the morning till i see if the <unk> comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half <unk> under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUMBER> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the <unk> that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that <unk> way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old <unk> in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those <unk> saying passing the <unk> of <unk> lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt <unk> hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be <unk> me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes <unk> anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even <unk> a nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUMBER> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUMBER> lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a <unk> nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUMBER> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where <unk> know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those <unk> <unk> in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that <unk> fellow with the fine eyes <unk> a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of <unk> listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great <unk> don <unk> de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUMBER> s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be <unk> around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and <unk> when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual <unk> house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that <unk> me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little <unk> jacket i <unk> crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the <unk> about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of <unk> around the city meeting god knows who <unk> and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to <unk> none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so <unk> im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUMBER> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar <unk> <unk>

her rounds with the <unk> and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in <unk> i could do the <unk> the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos <unk> <unk> <unk> lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs

not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUMBER> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want £ <NUMBER> or perhaps ill tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to <unk> it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt <unk> all my good drawers o i
