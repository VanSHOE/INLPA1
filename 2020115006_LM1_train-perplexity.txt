it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	2.8397801525662403
"my dear mr bennet " said his lady to him one day "have you heard that netherfield park is let at last	2.3784002017072927
"but it is " returned she "for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it	2.724917429789355
mr bennet made no answer	1.0475829107465904
"do not you want to know who has taken it	2.574489125175672
cried his wife impatiently	1.7993190454736163
" you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it	2.6783196803367466
this was invitation enough	1.2262825376786903
"what is his name	1.3344098980251626
"is he married or single	1.2513049546464472
single my dear to be sure	1.965172570300314
a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year	1.6313484758251429
what a fine thing for our girls	1.8765598969096142
how can it affect them	1.4800652567481398
"my dear mr bennet " replied his wife "how can you be so tiresome	2.2554306225687015
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them	2.8353905757103726
"is that his design in settling here	1.8196960468194037
nonsense how can you talk so	1.5562722748388804
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes	3.775053205324394
"i see no occasion for that	1.6884820151634492
"my dear you flatter me	1.4932109838524028
i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now	2.945779270898031
when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty	2.6558698787968793
"in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of	2.3345768747376607
"but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood	2.872874258151169
"it is more than i engage for i assure you	2.1580070343145614
"but consider your daughters	1.3055608947720678
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them	2.6767426498016804
indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not	2.5535376087723094
"you are over <unk> surely	1.4939618435382593
i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy	1.9952623149688797
lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia	2.992708098659142
but you are always giving her the preference	2.1990074340010968
"they have none of them much to recommend them " replied he "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters	2.61086677480404
"mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way	2.4090815491580058
you have no compassion on my poor nerves	2.265153373659391
i have a high respect for your nerves	2.359460245566204
they are my old friends	1.453694505351594
you do not know what i suffer	3.024664332992215
"but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	2.61255081071754
"it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them	2.8346110362479386
<unk> upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all	2.708498687248323
she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper	2.3999328250262164
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous	2.983749138206401
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its <unk> was visiting and news	2.511444769945436
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley	2.6570027505515177
he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it	2.6826957952797255
it was then <unk> in the following manner	2.826628795726316
"we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes " said her mother resentfully "since we are not to visit	3.1133061423738324
"but you forget mama " said elizabeth "that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him	2.5902328741844904
"i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing	2.711721760140022
she has two nieces of her own	1.7495110028514242
she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her	2.8187683864821143
"no more have i " said mr bennet "and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her <unk> you	3.0090918102007778
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters	2.411737204433207
"don't keep <unk> so kitty for heaven's sake	1.7517037063016623
you tear them to pieces	1.966972563592473
"kitty has no discretion in her <unk> " said her father "she times them ill	2.6582182871684084
"when is your next ball to be lizzy	1.9883283277801467
"aye so it is " cried her mother "and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself	2.610157215682537
"then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her	3.037142453629542
"i honour your circumspection	1.2293133521576802
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little	1.7348612656620608
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight	2.2207809099396143
but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself	2.232735148777284
"what can be the meaning of that <unk> exclamation	2.1813095682151986
"do you consider the forms of introduction and the <unk> that is laid on them as nonsense	3.3753616714826036
i cannot quite agree with you there	1.7391899223918794
what say you mary	1.3784732869905705
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts	2.8075783507313945
mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how	2.2158934784577
"i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before	2.806484811426562
it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now	2.983826777139792
"how good it was in you my dear mr bennet	2.461876813029591
but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance	2.4296708385343795
well how pleased i am	1.3438503662550254
and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now	3.050419183693531
"now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse " said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife	3.055658050720482
"what an excellent father you have girls " said she when the door was shut	2.5832300373940082
"i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter	2.837507246545697
at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing	2.951316987029184
lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball	2.6179270623934268
said lydia <unk> "i am not afraid for though i am the youngest <unk> the <unk> the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet's visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner	2.2758459260747883
not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley	2.7282497186442805
they <unk> him in various ways with <unk> questions ingenious <unk> and distant <unk> but he <unk> the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	2.4244620170823286
he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to <unk> the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party	3.1383528015999214
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingley's heart were entertained	2.5691395132477646
"if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield " said mrs bennet to her husband "and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for	2.761699813343848
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet's visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library	2.8119387800793514
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father	2.7667136921363396
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all	2.4174888520231583
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c	3.5191561775506255
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be	2.154434690031884
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by <unk> the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	2.085205857248754
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were <unk> the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin	2.4816289228368253
and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man	2.5441086940626025
his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion	2.296334838157552
his brother in law mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble <unk> and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year	1.9429496147158305
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his <unk> for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most <unk> disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend	1.4556047973707602
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves	1.7519183892980665
what a contrast between him and his friend	2.3807139449089996
mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party	2.3713737056616555
he was the <unk> most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again	3.3709872550981665
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters	2.5559165964310253
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the <unk> of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it	1.8529220216409523
"come darcy " said he "i must have you dance	2.8498302450536745
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner	2.3496290187603646
"i certainly shall not	1.2319740866722972
you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner	2.3308996387120575
at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable	2.82677284549624
your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with	3.1904890239657453
"i would not be so fastidious as you are " cried bingley "for a kingdom	3.1911731622869417
upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty	2.77011396307189
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld	2.3750883765490363
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable	3.07812838079912
"which do you mean	1.283875887247793
and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till <unk> her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said "she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men	1.968419447286612
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are <unk> your time with me	2.8476205955156
mr bingley followed his advice	1.452840474881041
mr darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him	2.1734677253870114
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family	1.9383367775935971
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party	2.912364377569216
mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters	2.5987397299758253
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a <unk> way	3.2664953667776393
elizabeth felt jane's pleasure	1.224935586053669
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	2.232735148777284
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants	2.7255535719260973
they found mr bennet still up	1.7086980933528564
with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations	2.848035868435802
he had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	3.026957180135955
my dear mr bennet " as she entered the room "we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball	2.5110855007779125
i wish you had been there	1.4986751598559542
jane was so admired nothing could be like it	2.10862135167366
every body said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice	2.338681235601654
only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time	2.8426132842310867
first of all he asked miss lucas	1.8795384756974078
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance	2.4244620170823286
so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next	2.6928661317508444
then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two <unk> with jane again and the two <unk> with lizzy and the <unk> " "if he had had any compassion for me " cried her husband impatiently "he would not have danced half so much	1.8957356524063758
for <unk> sake say no more of his partners	2.344169663022221
that he had <unk> his <unk> in the first dance	5.184668202564525
my dear " continued mrs bennet "i am quite delighted with him	2.6967879482662225
he is so excessively handsome	1.8146995225603224
i dare say the <unk> upon mrs <unk> gown " here she was interrupted again	2.826969599948901
mr bennet protested against any description of finery	1.6726018649698804
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some <unk> the shocking rudeness of mr darcy	2.5399256652570736
"but i can assure you " she added "that lizzy does not lose much by not <unk> his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing	2.942727176209282
he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great	2.1747283498707852
not handsome enough to dance with	1.1978870579659922
i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set <unk>	2.844637891724866
i quite detest the man	1.3592256512989485
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him	3.1051750235819844
"he is just what a young man ought to be " said she <unk> good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners	3.079247399573894
"he is also handsome " replied elizabeth "which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can	2.642253808636097
his character is thereby complete	1.4175922506704712
"i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time	2.4447140271972643
i did not expect such a compliment	2.2939171692512037
i did for you	1.2977575078815125
but that is one great difference between us	2.2422177784774595
what could be more natural than his asking you again	2.303634635541601
no thanks to his gallantry for that	1.8745024454300372
well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him	2.388800630858384
you are a great deal too <unk> you know to like people in general	3.1594454386748336
you never see a fault in any body	1.9297001411175532
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes	2.1006468838398815
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	2.448666039562517
"i would wish not to be hasty in <unk> any one but i always speak what i think	3.103520384460322
"i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder	2.725199213251173
with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others	2.557713847250198
affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every where	1.830172017315627
but to be <unk> without <unk> or design to take the good of every body's character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone	3.046989570903508
and so you like this man's sisters too do you	1.8529659034464943
their manners are not equal to his	1.9975604531267512
"certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them	2.513330037847247
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her	3.060736798348168
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less <unk> of temper than her sister and with a judgment too <unk> by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them	1.8957356524063758
they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited	2.8555813296923085
mr bingley <unk> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it	2.4001110393386766
mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the <unk> of his days at netherfield and leave the next <unk> to purchase	1.7455628235338618
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a <unk> miss bingley was by no means unwilling to <unk> at his table nor was mrs hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her	1.7455628235338618
mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house	2.9691850195242324
he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately	2.761699813343848
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character	3.1877072136853464
bingley was <unk> to darcy by the easiness openness <unk> of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied	2.848035868435802
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion	2.404101429170407
in understanding darcy was the superior	1.7622104614302763
bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever	2.22837070705065
he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting	2.356751573684346
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	2.2781439926517915
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence	2.1518136585732957
darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure	2.543345761304649
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much	2.2548910936787627
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of	2.543345761304649
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate	2.420380044835774
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and <unk> to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his <unk>	2.848035868435802
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	1.6731062473688483
for though <unk> by his rank it did not render him <unk> on the contrary he was all attention to every body	2.946719338576431
by nature <unk> friendly and obliging his presentation at st james's had made him <unk>	1.970287677012212
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet	2.7916326754927634
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate	2.761699813343848
" you began the evening well charlotte " said mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas	2.4948332896545433
" you were mr bingley's first choice	1.8435713592365714
"yes but he seemed to like his second better	2.34882385959725
you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice	1.7832956697445161
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson	2.9498601270695266
"perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you	2.4333138356243036
mr <unk> asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the <unk>	2.942727176209282
and his answering immediately to the last question oh	2.298576282814894
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point	2.1102191921475395
well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know	2.4528772286995633
" my <unk> were more to the purpose than yours eliza " said charlotte	2.4782062063415577
"mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he	2.76287404112288
to be only just tolerable	1.5016367771433345
"i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him	2.610157215682537
mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	2.4678787024419133
"are you quite sure ma'am	1.4858121593859908
is not there a little mistake	1.709736132237087
"i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her	1.9305845303474816
"i do not believe a word of it my dear	2.552454811083399
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long	3.2416283847225325
"i do not mind his not talking to mrs long " said miss lucas "but i wish he had danced with eliza	3.190045067404005
<unk> time lizzy " said her mother "i would not dance with him if i were you	2.59063811953188
"i believe ma'am i may safely promise you never to dance with him	1.9972167943591979
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself	2.78048343818767
if i may so express it he has a right to be proud	2.60586778349848
"that is very true " replied elizabeth "and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine	2.886508352469836
<unk> " observed mary who <unk> herself upon the solidity of her reflections "is a very common failing i believe	2.8275826305965657
by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not <unk> a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary	1.9429496147158305
vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used <unk>	2.1976213055572065
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us	2.346387452264346
"if i were as rich as mr darcy " cried a young lucas who came with his sisters "i should not care how proud i was	2.615120996048585
i would keep a pack of <unk> and drink a bottle of wine every day	2.4058188142796464
"then you would drink a great deal more than you ought " said mrs bennet "and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly	2.9960660242115646
the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit	2.764641657082292
the visit was returned in due form	1.8812069256731403
it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent	1.4440241885954521
"it may perhaps be pleasant " replied charlotte "to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded	3.046989570903508
if a woman <unk> her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark	2.4244620170823286
we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement	2.4408468547729556
in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels	2.171411124259351
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on	2.509989402810443
"but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow	2.6956611176875716
if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too	2.989876806581516
"remember eliza that he does not know jane's disposition as you do	2.439880382664595
"but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out	2.5894031622731166
"perhaps he must if he sees enough of her	1.9492216945385155
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention	2.643484343008834
"your plan is a good one " replied elizabeth "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it	2.321954250288982
but these are not jane's feelings she is not acting by design	2.3966325165656555
she has known him only a fortnight	1.855741632083597
she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times	2.6832046014851896
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character	2.7084696519115186
"not as you represent it	1.5141906934822487
had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal	2.543345761304649
"yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <unk> <unk> better than <unk> but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded	2.6826957952797255
"well " said charlotte "i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth	2.192345972483447
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance	1.960575235982737
if the <unk> of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life	1.6744824380115346
"you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound	2.3996447904474163
you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself	3.1084572691412924
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to <unk>	2.848035868435802
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	2.321954250288982
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one <unk> of perfect <unk> in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his <unk> that her manners were not those of the <unk> world he was caught by their easy playfulness	1.9187520990478337
of this she was perfectly <unk> to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with	3.150031256418771
he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others	3.0625687326013087
his doing so drew her notice	1.505140995447627
"what does mr darcy mean " said she to charlotte "by listening to my conversation with colonel forster	2.504643236471662
"that is a question which mr darcy only can answer	2.573266183538497
on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas <unk> her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said "did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton	1.6744824380115346
"with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady <unk>	2.7616603477857113
"you are severe on us	1.2134063605977248
"i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows	2.351548910627546
always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body	2.193829847128036
if my vanity had taken a <unk> turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <unk>	2.4816289228368253
on miss lucas's <unk> however she added "very well if it must be so it <unk> and gravely glancing at mr darcy "there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with <unk> your breath to cool your <unk> ' and i shall keep mine to <unk> my song	1.8957356524063758
her performance was pleasing though by no means capital	2.2040802692363304
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a <unk> air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached	2.543345761304649
"what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy	1.9786231271889934
there is nothing like dancing after all	2.136610705853042
i consider it as one of the first <unk> of polished societies	2.566141629496671
"certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in <unk> amongst the less polished societies of the world	2.5166426034138594
every <unk> can dance	1.3646788746672474
sir william only smiled	1.2266293730843612
"your friend <unk> delightfully " he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group "and i doubt not that you are an <unk> in the <unk> yourself mr darcy	2.8351936335999848
"you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir	1.9710253255069492
"yes indeed and received no <unk> pleasure from the sight	2.0465979413651656
do you often dance at st james's	1.4849992379706796
"do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	2.9310774095520395
"you have a house in town i conclude	2.3418885072843425
he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very <unk> thing and called out to her "my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing	1.9952623149688797
you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you	2.629007251576146
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william "indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing	2.154434690031884
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner	2.5268332849966333
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain	2.4716662780963303
elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	2.2633561121902024
"mr darcy is all politeness " said elizabeth smiling	3.1824686271025517
"he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner	2.544873400184265
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley "i can guess the subject of your <unk>	2.942727176209282
"i should imagine not	1.2243512570028294
"you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion	2.995070728653015
i was never more <unk>	1.659034219638307
the <unk> and yet the noise the <unk> and yet the self importance of all these people	2.890724859151081
what would i give to hear your <unk> on them	2.2120079449201424
"your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you	1.5403273768047905
my mind was more agreeably engaged	1.7342445835884313
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	2.8748522322932213
mr darcy replied with great <unk> "miss elizabeth bennet	2.0666859911866053
how long has she been such a favourite	2.108427507319368
and pray when am i to wish you joy	2.0840193744253357
"that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask	2.2382692438846914
a lady's imagination is very rapid it <unk> from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment	2.27448375798976
i knew you would be wishing me joy	2.095822569914104
"nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled	2.959436810093577
you will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you	3.2143878054177244
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit <unk> long	2.8123600167459086
mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in <unk> of <unk> <unk> on a distant relation and their mother's fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his	2.023589647725157
her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds	2.2956088629196425
she had a sister married to a mr philips who had been a <unk> to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade	2.6826957952797255
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a <unk> shop just over the way	2.154434690031884
the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters' and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt	1.701254279852589
at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters	2.610157215682537
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections	2.1828764333108417
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves	2.728907748530889
mr philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before	2.2696816884729882
they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingley's large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <unk>	2.5609690999917825
i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced	2.5255715122040865
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london	2.321954250288982
"i am astonished my dear " said mrs bennet "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly	3.1055349700393844
if i wished to think <unk> of any body's children it should not be of my own however	2.9885360268873185
"if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	2.4510198980842826
"yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever	2.9759062551286064
"this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree	2.697172562582686
i had hoped that our sentiments <unk> in every particular but i must so far <unk> from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish	2.908911692819142
"my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother	3.2278953515016813
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do	2.892264226970528
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals	1.701254279852589
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <unk> with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer	2.8165372282293686
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read "well jane who is it from	2.591062633770863
what is it about	1.6091803646067333
what does he say	1.337256909974853
well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love	2.0433697952824557
"it is from miss bingley " said jane and then read it aloud	2.66985214647148
"my dear friend "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me we shall be in danger of <unk> each other for the rest of our lives for a whole day's tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel	2.023589647725157
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this	2.3219141475039358
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	2.5600243671247673
yours ever "caroline bingley	1.1843134071187473
<unk> out " said mrs bennet "that is very unlucky	2.2775556532032573
"can i have the carriage	2.0019133697083302
"no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night	2.734036812314714
but the gentlemen will have mr bingley's chaise to go to meryton and the <unk> have no horses to theirs	2.972645259424488
"i had much rather go in the coach	1.8743594944910154
"but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure	2.2702255871470256
they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they	1.8002264723743173
"they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them	1.9491728989658799
"but if you have got them to day " said elizabeth "my mother's purpose will be answered	2.774770156000609
she did at last <unk> from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged	2.6360850635425437
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful <unk> of a bad day	3.180284268278522
her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it <unk> hard	2.7338319004630893
"this was a lucky idea of mine indeed	1.7747618958037867
said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	3.0304731133748173
till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance	3.5177214209173164
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth "my dearest lizzy "i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday	2.4816289228368253
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better	2.3036726217923444
they insist also on my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a <unk> <unk> and head <unk> there is not much the matter with me	2.4244620170823286
"well my dear " said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud "if your daughter should have a <unk> fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders	2.053525026457146
people do not die of little trifling <unk>	1.7888867233913375
she will be taken good care of	2.228363691113664
as long as she <unk> there it is all very well	3.044486081770598
i would go and see her if i could have the carriage	2.920574544068688
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horse woman walking was her only alternative	3.144189424577403
she declared her resolution	1.2286412333579928
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there	3.117894522143972
"is this a hint to me lizzy " said her father "to send for the horses	2.298228332213574
the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles	2.026193181740763
i shall be back by dinner	2.293393075349446
"i admire the activity of your benevolence " observed mary "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	2.490524439279332
"we will go as far as meryton with you " said catherine and lydia	2.560911925472837
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together	1.9581767756697028
in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' <unk> and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick <unk> <unk> over <unk> and springing over <unk> with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty <unk> and a face <unk> with the warmth of exercise	1.701254279852589
she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise	2.561669860951295
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it	2.3713737056616555
she was received however very politely by them and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness	2.602983229978351
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	2.468077071098437
miss bennet had <unk> ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room	2.71118959470861
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance	2.2758459260747883
she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little <unk> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	2.7394963166185895
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane	2.703985225504829
the apothecary came and having examined his <unk> said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts	2.2758459260747883
the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head <unk> acutely	2.1688452320546725
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere	2.8354019413066216
when the <unk> struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so	2.54231762982735
elizabeth most <unk> consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes	3.401134457701294
to the civil enquiries which then <unk> in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley's she could not make a very favourable answer	2.942727176209282
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	1.7782794100389228
she had very little notice from any but him	1.9385063534728164
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an <unk> man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a <unk> had nothing to say to her	1.8957356524063758
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	2.865710417149354
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty	2.8914538831468315
mrs hurst thought the same and added "she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker	2.5949226479760266
i shall never forget her appearance this morning	1.9223353902410976
she really looked almost wild	1.3886971246803608
"she did indeed louisa	1.303882979532148
i could hardly keep my countenance	1.8940383059337436
very nonsensical to come at all	1.6148876317762926
why must she be <unk> about the country because her sister had a cold	2.6393248522581536
her hair so <unk> so <unk>	1.7898048917161116
"yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six <unk> deep in <unk> i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office	2.761699813343848
"your picture may be very exact louisa " said bingley "but this was all lost upon me	2.513129529530487
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning	2.4955056212485487
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice	1.5550921327684684
" you observed it mr darcy i am sure " said miss bingley "and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition	2.7616471115297316
what could she mean by it	1.7048846510567988
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum	2.341109345247912
"it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing " said bingley	2.6004834538740185
"i am afraid mr darcy " observed miss bingley in a half whisper "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes	2.6207446707608697
"not at all " he replied "they were <unk> by the exercise	2.926624532104928
a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again	2.5470121432656034
"i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled	2.395593180617405
but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it	2.9298114650603524
"i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton	1.925953255810733
"yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside	2.084085999998407
"that is capital " added her sister and they both laughed heartily	2.574340879822853
"if they had uncles enough to <unk> all cheapside " cried bingley "it would not make them one <unk> less agreeable	2.83027331263871
"but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world " replied darcy	2.8089391495863874
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty <unk> and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations	2.4345183112738313
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee	2.416126388375058
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her <unk> and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	2.192345972483447
on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book	1.968419447286612
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment	1.8798786294487762
said he "that is rather singular	1.7775357891807269
"miss eliza bennet " said miss bingley <unk> cards	2.2685126622385408
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else	2.8084713020132877
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were <unk>	2.6538082568808607
"and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into	2.761699813343848
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room	2.6498480311397956
"i am astonished " said miss bingley "that my father should have left so small a collection of books	2.59619655521504
"it ought to be good " he replied "it has been the work of many generations	3.1012293146239425
"and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always <unk> books	2.5813069226272103
"i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these	2.1370180940115318
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place	2.6020864617324837
charles when you <unk> your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley	2.6312279930667337
"i wish it may	1.0853251819851994
"but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model	2.610493895509146
"i am talking of <unk> charles	1.6958183505141367
"upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by <unk>	2.587732707050974
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game	2.192345972483447
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring	1.8892349526406345
said miss bingley "will she be as tall as i am	2.4752893978013453
"i think she will	1.224392161276274
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height or rather <unk>	1.9742420532796812
such a countenance such manners	1.5344991198589994
and so extremely accomplished for her age	1.6932272378609783
her performance on the piano forte is <unk>	1.7907246625922852
"it is amazing to me " said bingley "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are	2.7908467037415567
my dear charles what do you mean	1.8240768272688204
"yes all of them i think	2.1791358874710314
they all <unk> tables <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>	2.109505044795172
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished	2.761699813343848
"your list of the common extent of accomplishments " said darcy "has too much truth	2.4624507314207253
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by <unk> a <unk> or covering a <unk>	2.6979437507242308
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general	2.797727909984606
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished	2.6276425038608506
<unk> i i am sure " said miss bingley	1.7676332025407129
"then " observed elizabeth "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman	2.498159494761495
"yes i do comprehend a great deal in it	2.1113530117786894
certainly " cried his faithful <unk> "no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly <unk> what is usually met with	2.4045751852847856
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern <unk> to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved	1.8957356524063758
"all this she must possess " added darcy "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading	2.8340246859533322
"i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women	2.101018956763271
i rather wonder now at your knowing any	1.753136199951834
"are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this	2.4513808352040667
" i never saw such a woman	1.723392762727051
i never saw such <unk> and taste and application and elegance as you describe united	2.5046273434664967
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	2.1187853261287715
as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room	2.1469532479995697
<unk> bennet " said miss bingley when the door was closed on her "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by <unk> their own and with many men i dare say it <unk>	2.321954250288982
but in my opinion it is a paltry <unk> a very mean art	2.83109418110288
"undoubtedly " replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed "there is <unk> in all the arts which ladies sometimes <unk> to employ for <unk>	2.5774490574545506
whatever bears affinity to <unk> is <unk>	1.7361408165228531
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject	2.988573525356782
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her	3.524983343917379
this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better	2.3713737056616555
bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable	2.5400082132256143
they <unk> their wretchedness however by <unk> after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	2.4244620170823286
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters	1.8957356524063758
in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation	2.906813518764875
mrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield	1.7615770326037883
after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingley's appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour	2.51752946442025
bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected	2.583423063710541
"indeed i have sir " was her answer	1.653382877110759
"she is a great deal too ill to be moved	2.5040436080543906
mr jones says we must not think of moving her	2.382958878824607
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness	2.1375776040476233
"it must not be thought of	2.0354492290428805
my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal	3.1175982920119734
"you may depend upon it madam " said miss bingley with cold civility "that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us	2.6508703565484253
mrs bennet was <unk> in her acknowledgments	2.4581192105117102
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her	2.1572385726982675
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield	3.087153116514905
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short <unk>	3.324188792909445
"whatever i do is done in a hurry " replied he "and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes	2.59433574076903
at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here	1.9894722753251335
"you begin to comprehend me do you	1.8193045579125968
cried he turning towards her	1.2081796651749377
"i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful	3.5299876258215717
"that is as it happens	1.6474890184680184
it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	2.5987261910378234
"i did not know before " continued bingley immediately "that you were a <unk> of character	2.7741426385441144
"yes but intricate characters are the most amusing	1.8074757849878622
they have at least that advantage	1.951347285951271
"the country " said darcy "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study	2.4942656223285162
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and <unk> society	2.333963578147347
"but people themselves <unk> so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever	2.583623112659535
"i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town	2.5055877301301877
every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away	3.027898405370062
"i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the <unk> and public places	2.9182381676189437
they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either	2.2592249408948564
"aye that is because you have the right disposition	2.66381526728412
"indeed mama you are mistaken " said elizabeth <unk> for her mother	2.562246764036404
"you quite <unk> mr darcy	1.4362535481947178
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true	2.687289975142689
"certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few <unk> larger	2.6541730415814064
i know we dine with four and twenty families	1.8910289809399214
nothing but concern for elizabeth could <unk> bingley to keep his countenance	2.351162408358254
his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile	2.701644191231136
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away	2.9638849814045334
"yes she called yesterday with her father	1.7433083696952614
what an agreeable man sir william is mr bingley is not he	2.373508952376561
so much the man of fashion	2.338539114267661
so genteel and so easy	1.5402132146484036
that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter	2.224689061467415
"did charlotte dine with you	1.3886146863241955
"no she would go home	1.6747053887764385
for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently	2.5735786283893916
but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you	2.4674993661345788
it is a pity they are not handsome	2.765698674663176
not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend	2.5367692529896217
"she seems a very pleasant young woman " said bingley	1.9436704545261465
lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane's beauty	1.9996515250267806
i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking	3.256847688257113
it is what every body says	1.990444564452517
i do not trust my own partiality	3.1829830452456918
when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away	2.4816289228368253
but however he did not	1.16774895715489
perhaps he thought her too young	1.8342999088733798
however he wrote some <unk> on her and very pretty they were	2.3366530235899883
"and so ended his affection " said elizabeth impatiently	2.5521946950014605
"there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way	2.5909690145794877
i wonder who first discovered the <unk> of poetry in driving away love	2.5468226357358934
"i have been used to consider poetry as the <unk> of love " said darcy	3.49709708585492
every thing <unk> what is strong already	2.018671371145399
but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good <unk> will <unk> it entirely away	2.7427417081368026
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth <unk> lest her mother should be exposing herself again	2.2958499716309584
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for <unk> him also with lizzy	2.4244620170823286
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required	2.5603825004484477
she performed her part indeed without much <unk> but mrs bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage	2.7647966748010537
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	2.1758934987747502
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield	2.2758459260747883
lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age	2.67094919883097
she had high <unk> spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance	2.641173417246086
she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	2.3713737056616555
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's <unk>	2.1516268555145492
"i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball	2.741400627059963
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill	2.2475670356553996
lydia declared herself satisfied	1.3369069929169934
yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again	2.8204706606177905
and when you have given your ball " she added "i shall insist on their giving one also	2.4516307140576217
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	2.4310450836974207
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley's <unk> on fine eyes	1.8329807108324359
the day passed much as the day before had done	2.74257123813303
mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the <unk> who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room	2.848035868435802
the loo table however did not appear	1.7532644417663754
mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by <unk> to his sister	3.097586690806756
mr hurst and mr bingley were at <unk> and mrs hurst was observing their game	3.028047693442569
elizabeth took up some <unk> and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion	2.6399676939129844
the <unk> <unk> of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in <unk> with her opinion of each	2.023589647725157
"how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter	2.291905210062366
he made no answer	1.028028340837974
"you write uncommonly <unk> "you are mistaken	1.7514981308586335
i write rather slowly	1.2273713538967106
"how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year	2.5848609632028805
letters of business too	1.302132794843308
how odious i should think them	2.03874343081221
"it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	2.353596455239189
"pray tell your sister that i long to see her	2.257222832034332
"i have already told her so once by your desire	2.0639807406863
"i am afraid you do not like your pen	3.073825556123082
let me mend it for you	1.604560966627279
i mend <unk> remarkably well	1.3083126180367382
"thank you but i always mend my own	2.396867539909537
"how can you contrive to write so even	2.21499453979105
"tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the <unk> and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss <unk>	2.2758459260747883
"will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again	2.3221143822429884
at present i have not room to do them justice	3.1194560491345014
it is of no consequence	1.962156824397686
i shall see her in january	1.7991177145796222
but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy	2.073104878031819
"they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine	2.3108959376952445
"it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill	2.623256812293508
he studies too much for words of four <unk>	2.2460321527131857
do not you darcy	1.7999006862729465
"my style of writing is very different from yours	2.084119145307701
cried miss bingley <unk> <unk> in the most careless way imaginable	3.524777843455286
he leaves out half his words and <unk> the <unk> "my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <unk>	2.543345761304649
it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect <unk> "and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty	2.5651187876347743
when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very <unk> in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <unk> and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else	1.6876124757881479
and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment	2.7536691006886573
"i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such <unk>	3.3209845569696483
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were <unk> your horse a friend were to say <unk> you had better stay till next week ' you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month	1.8529220216409523
"i am exceedingly gratified " said bingley "by your <unk> what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper	2.513518578485582
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a <unk> denial and ride off as fast as i could	2.085205857248754
"would mr darcy then consider the <unk> of your original intention as <unk> for by your obstinacy in <unk> to it	3.229540003548994
"upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself	2.336641250955041
"you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged	2.8006296005986653
"to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you	2.2507904285997378
"to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either	2.112086549012396
"you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection	2.7327185246345977
a regard for the <unk> would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it	2.4041856697316013
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley	3.2391350430335453
we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance <unk> before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon	2.432965924623544
"will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to <unk> with rather more <unk> the degree of importance which is to <unk> to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties	2.4244620170823286
"by all means " cried bingley "let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of	2.5328973866873232
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference	3.0992292240615673
i declare i do not know a more <unk> object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do	2.6205615795178074
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an <unk> with her brother for talking such nonsense	2.917274956838583
"i see your design bingley " said his friend	2.144598297443086
"you dislike an argument and want to silence this	1.7741193049790112
arguments are too much like <unk>	1.7166272770106454
"what you ask " said elizabeth "is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter	2.970850701774122
mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	1.7489225553743917
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly <unk> she seated herself	2.614624466137014
mrs hurst <unk> with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcy's eyes were fixed on her	2.4816289228368253
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange	2.6826957952797255
she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present	2.6826957952797255
she liked him too little to care for his approbation	2.3968643378907943
after playing some <unk> <unk> miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her "do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to <unk> such an opportunity of dancing a reel	2.192345972483447
she smiled but made no answer	1.3220275597655804
he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence	2.1348504659767817
said she "i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply	2.995674040473761
you wanted me i know to say <unk> ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in <unk> those kind of schemes and <unk> a person of their <unk> contempt	2.543345761304649
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare	3.2053130187644827
"indeed i do not dare	2.7386448703018877
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and <unk> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so <unk> by any woman as he was by her	2.053525026457146
he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger	2.737304675721336
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth	2.3674923242108834
she often tried to provoke darcy into <unk> her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	2.382677424502892
"i hope " said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day "you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can <unk> it do <unk> the younger girls of running after the officers	1.8529220216409523
and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady <unk>	2.444982408964161
"have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity	2.1634011551514796
do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley	2.4725157417586665
put them next to your great uncle the judge	1.8914413816392746
they are in the same profession you know only in different lines	2.5763508365861987
as for your elizabeth's picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what <unk> could do justice to those beautiful eyes	2.7429740193106333
"it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye <unk> so remarkably fine might be copied	2.5989769115849497
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself	2.740412530786209
"i did not know that you intended to walk " said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard	3.130544649235892
"you used us abominably ill " answered mrs hurst "in running away without telling us that you were coming out	2.4437640483524903
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself	2.582842037159049
the path just admitted three	1.3777693361206191
you are charmingly <unk> and appear to uncommon advantage	1.7608709275320709
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she <unk> about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two	2.4953102721182376
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	2.2213500433169906
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	1.8139306939110624
their powers of conversation were considerable	1.6836423031130443
they could describe an entertainment with <unk> relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit	2.421471843994118
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object	2.958201164131379
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps	3.035543834798098
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite <unk> mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was "very glad " but <unk> and warmth remained for bingley's salutation	2.7415219528530645
he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	2.3597886862530646
elizabeth at work in the opposite <unk> saw it all with great delight	2.2330332097818593
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain	2.4946062271151463
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open <unk> rejected	2.5196369353260137
she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her	3.0370612133503165
darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her <unk> and <unk> joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet	2.848035868435802
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcy's progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page	2.758257214827708
she could not <unk> him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on	2.9324020588859265
when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library	4.026192637195341
no one made any reply	1.4528693145997278
she then <unk> again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said "by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield	1.968419447286612
i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure	2.3713737056616555
"if you mean darcy " cried her brother "he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards	2.1187853261287715
"i should like balls infinitely better " she replied "if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something <unk> <unk> in the usual <unk> of such a meeting	2.942727176209282
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day	2.179120442121506
<unk> more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball	2.605165630507665
miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room	2.293839636940524
her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all <unk> was still <unk> <unk>	2.7959388495983757
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <unk>	2.734151577454044
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately	1.9988944533313644
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book	2.5723278620578167
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their <unk> to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would <unk>	2.321954250288982
"what could he mean	1.37738788081658
she was dying to know what could be his <unk> and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him	2.848709232755814
"not at all " was her answer "but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our <unk> way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it	2.5132080153587113
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing and <unk> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives	2.630348802289537
"you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each <unk> confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your <unk> appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire	1.7301957388458942
"i never heard any thing so abominable	2.0082799029173035
how shall we punish him for such a speech	2.245185783562383
"nothing so easy if you have but the inclination " said elizabeth	2.3147236909888145
"we can all plague and punish one another	1.6689002542615012
teaze him laugh at him	1.414166364335734
intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done	2.811076209471211
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind	1.7064707256354714
no no i feel he may defy us there	2.0367911774878937
and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject	2.4636274321090146
mr darcy may <unk> himself	1.7656256782637405
"mr darcy is not to be laughed at	2.694658839348239
"that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance	2.8311578139833995
i dearly love a laugh	1.4523020871102683
"miss bingley " said he "has given me credit for more than can be	2.6240454155157007
the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke	2.6211637761848805
"certainly " replied elizabeth "there are such people but i hope i am not one of them	3.0646965880403427
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good	2.1007165800851197
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do <unk> me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can	2.7589089499553556
but these i suppose are <unk> what you are without	2.470133299279249
"perhaps that is not possible for any one	2.168722753388385
<unk> as vanity and pride	1.2249646024652163
but pride where there is a real <unk> of mind pride will be always under good <unk>	2.690350973870647
"your examination of mr darcy is over i presume " said miss bingley "and pray what is the result	3.1787530434681157
"i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect	2.9870541883142976
<unk> said darcy "i have made no such pretension	2.308571778712408
my temper i dare not vouch for	2.027669815561753
it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world	2.197551578453974
i cannot forget the follies and <unk> of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself	2.8268699782129287
my feelings are not <unk> about with every attempt to move them	2.2061939224043368
my temper would perhaps be called resentful	1.7473996232842184
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever	1.5930402093923646
" that is a failing indeed	1.8992526789028361
<unk> resentment is a shade in a character	3.0870401362146738
but you have chosen your fault well	1.9619176177951831
i really cannot laugh at it	1.5298653775721334
you are safe from me	1.3628324674551096
"there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome	2.3713409166738293
"and your defect is a <unk> to hate every body	2.6762504900957014
"do let us have a little music " cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share	3.091750415741533
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention	2.3834576307100486
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day	2.942727176209282
mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well	2.3713737056616555
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred	2.68342859235816
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	3.19500227884167
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right	2.053525026457146
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough	3.166448589625786
she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself	2.928996191749785
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could <unk> her with the hope of <unk> his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <unk> it	1.9429496147158305
steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he <unk> most <unk> to his book and would not even look at her	2.192345972483447
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former	1.9187520990478337
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	2.2228881049689604
mrs bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again	2.531794195818585
but their father though very <unk> in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle	2.9387068260447564
the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth	2.545500696784016
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough <unk> and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bare <unk> to listen to	2.2572353338917495
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been <unk> and it had actually been <unk> that colonel forster was going to be married	2.154434690031884
"i hope my dear " said mr bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning "that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party	2.3713737056616555
"who do you mean my dear	2.0599856360796136
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her	2.885776825053116
i do not believe she often sees such at home	2.710023073766754
"the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger	2.2982929970631667
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled	1.0373531944573957
"a gentleman and a stranger	1.3049346004719844
it is mr bingley i am sure	1.8009778088860227
why jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing	2.427991085453131
well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley	2.8576774678973385
there is not a bit of fish to be got to day	2.2936046017439184
lydia my love ring the bell	1.5722555573177854
i must speak to hill this moment	1.8555826831503954
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	2.468680260170573
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained	2.1627105219446223
"about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention	2.710898506830111
it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	2.9723772830677047
my dear " cried his wife "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned	2.638473379331309
pray do not talk of that odious man	2.1320469382839193
i do think it is the <unk> thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it	2.192345972483447
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	2.720260127130031
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to <unk> bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	1.968419447286612
"it certainly is a most <unk> affair " said mr bennet "and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn	2.5388651124120862
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself	3.0220324366623
"no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical	3.775053205324394
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him	2.1734865602276887
"why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear	2.626406661988091
hunsford near <unk> kent th <unk>	1.4769977830861476
dear sir the <unk> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to <unk> the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem <unk> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at <unk>	1.566048452832833
my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received <unk> at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose <unk> and <unk> has preferred me to the valuable <unk> of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <unk> myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those <unk> and <unk> which are <unk> by the church of england	1.4677992676220695
as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present <unk> of good will are highly <unk> and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	1.5947870582948211
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of <unk> your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter	2.321954250288982
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november th by four o'clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day	1.566048452832833
i remain dear sir with <unk> compliments to your lady and daughters your well <unk> and friend william collins	2.366818835433098
"at four o'clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman " said mr bennet as he <unk> up the letter	2.4508695735826924
"he seems to be a most <unk> and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so <unk> as to let him come to us again	2.4244620170823286
"there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him	3.046989570903508
"though it is difficult " said jane "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit	2.6698329654170836
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of <unk> marrying and <unk> his <unk> whenever it were required	2.8566179280535327
"he must be an <unk> i think " said she	2.123310230162592
"i cannot make him out	1.5653714908699223
there is something very pompous in his style	2.1932215500797887
and what can he mean by <unk> for being next in the entail	1.8475753507177763
we cannot suppose he would help it if he could	2.064956978903176
can he be a sensible man sir	1.9525443420339335
"no my dear i think not	2.374573026788911
i have great hopes of finding him quite the <unk>	2.1151127359817448
there is a mixture of <unk> and self importance in his letter which promises well	3.285457866913889
"in point of <unk> " said mary "his letter does not seem defective	2.579126440996767
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed	2.8640488010358736
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting	2.4859561407071302
mr bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself	2.7935603055052702
he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty	2.503714587226678
his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal	2.289354483975989
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance <unk> had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	1.8139306939110624
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his <unk> but mrs bennet who <unk> with no compliments answered most readily "you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be <unk> enough	1.9952623149688797
"you <unk> perhaps to the entail of this estate	2.2426532748792245
sir i do indeed	1.4081895889442704
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess	2.644379466784608
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed	2.5380370107316543
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them	2.8718616284386194
at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted " he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other	2.879629669822313
they were not the only objects of mr collins's admiration	3.0081949405867037
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its <unk> was owing	2.6254797106069594
but here he was set right by mrs bennet who assured him with some <unk> that they were very well able to keep a good <unk> and that her daughters had nothing to do in the <unk>	2.543345761304649
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour	2.481927707301862
during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <unk> by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	2.085205857248754
lady catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable	2.6259091721671157
mr bennet could not have chosen better	2.826052105197365
she had been <unk> pleased to approve of both the <unk> which he had already had the honour of preaching before her	3.452461286726863
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her <unk> of quadrille in the evening	2.775528652207356
lady catherine was <unk> proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her	3.0103857572539816
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations	2.192345972483447
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the <unk> he had been making and had even <unk> to suggest some herself some <unk> in the <unk> up stairs	1.8329807108324359
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her	2.4599498489912697
does she live near you sir	1.5031232813447928
"the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyship's residence	2.280221723007092
"i think you said she was a widow sir	2.6180234755383203
has she any family	1.2292037360763024
"she has one only daughter the <unk> of rosings and of very extensive property	2.981452364594153
cried mrs bennet shaking her head "then she is better off than many girls	2.2778363455604422
and what sort of young lady is she	2.0349488153468367
"she is a most charming young lady indeed	2.84924686405981
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth	2.543345761304649
she is unfortunately of a sickly <unk> which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who <unk> her education and who still <unk> with them	2.2758459260747883
but she is perfectly amiable and often <unk> to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	2.5671439645143446
"has she been presented	1.352772699162828
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court	2.8584378858391024
"her indifferent state of health unhappily <unk> her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the <unk> court of its brightest <unk>	2.506764518698204
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies	2.998635833013106
i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a <unk> and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her	2.6826957952797255
"you judge very properly " said mr bennet "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy	2.3571343360865957
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study	2.371303687160071
"they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with <unk> and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as <unk> an air as possible	2.232735148777284
mr bennet's expectations were fully answered	1.4787633716634914
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most <unk> composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure	2.232735148777284
by tea time however the <unk> had been enough and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies	2.4816289228368253
mr collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a <unk> library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read <unk>	2.610157215682537
kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed	1.9967765426220714
other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose <unk> sermons	2.154319092900787
i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town	2.723685999013776
lydia was <unk> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr collins much offended laid aside his book and said "i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <unk> though written solely for their benefit	2.154434690031884
it <unk> me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction	2.6993675265869284
but i will no longer <unk> my young cousin	2.5114021084676237
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his <unk> at backgammon	2.7212132677788983
mr bennet accepted the <unk> observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements	2.360188257931676
mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would <unk> his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr bennet and prepared for backgammon	1.7615770326037883
mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <unk> and <unk> father and though he belonged to one of the <unk> he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance	1.7455628235338618
the <unk> in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity	2.1187853261287715
having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	1.9429496147158305
this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate and he thought it an excellent one full of <unk> and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part	2.6821156334005396
his plan did not vary on seeing them	1.825773563726455
miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views and established all his <unk> notions of what was due to <unk> and for the first evening she was his settled choice	2.9690866287419255
"as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged	2.053525026457146
mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennet was <unk> the fire	3.382830537179767
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue <unk> engaged with one of the <unk> <unk> in the collection but really talking to mr bennet with little <unk> of his house and garden at hunsford	1.4873521072935114
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most <unk> in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go	1.5085907086001784
in pompous <unk> on his side and civil <unk> on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton	2.5990588362229494
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him	2.551238912191696
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them	2.4816435288292604
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentleman like appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way	2.6826957952797255
the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed	2.363355233656445
mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps	2.543345761304649
this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming	3.1519503545795686
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen <unk> down the street	1.8957356524063758
on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities	2.5676413087143373
bingley was the principal <unk> and miss bennet the principal object	2.977959694682042
he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her	2.536223485728291
mr darcy <unk> it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	1.8957356524063758
both changed colour one looked white the other red	1.8550979255386062
what could be the meaning of it	2.067060769727986
it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know	2.6751755619016406
in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend	2.4091944714460887
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips's house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs <unk> throwing up the parlour window and loudly <unk> the invitation	1.968419447286612
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not <unk> them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr jones's shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by jane's introduction of him	1.4330125702369627
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice	2.023589647725157
she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the <unk> but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become <unk> disagreeable fellows	1.8329807108324359
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening	2.3713737056616555
mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with <unk> civility that they were perfectly needless	3.011346217743304
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have <unk> either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister	2.2758459260747883
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even <unk> included him in her invitation for the next evening <unk> <unk> unknown to her before	2.085205857248754
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	3.00918056998523
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt and all mr collins's scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <unk> the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation and was then in the house	1.566048452832833
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much <unk> but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine's drawing rooms and found that the <unk> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the <unk> room	1.318256738556407
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional <unk> in praise of his own humble abode and the <unk> it was receiving he was happily employed <unk> the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to <unk> it all among her neighbours as soon as she could	1.5947870582948211
it was over at last however	1.8386947617843554
the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	2.761699813343848
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentleman like set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the <unk> <unk> <unk> uncle philips <unk> <unk> wine who followed them into the room	1.79571449437164
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a <unk> season made her feel that the <unk> <unk> most thread bare <unk> might be rendered interesting by the skill of the <unk>	1.5753186734235158
with such <unk> for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and <unk>	1.8738174228603839
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist "i know little of the game at present " said he "but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life " mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason	1.7615770326037883
mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia	2.3147666556696995
at first there seemed danger of lydia's <unk> him entirely for she was a most determined <unk> but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making <unk> and exclaiming after <unk> to have attention for any one in particular	1.968419447286612
allowing for the common <unk> of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy	2.053525026457146
she dared not even mention that gentleman	2.207944831066968
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved	1.5723749989387106
mr wickham began the subject himself	1.917199529308997
he <unk> how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an <unk> manner how long mr darcy had been staying there	2.7969258285453527
"about a month " said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand	2.9074954969045548
a clear ten thousand per annum	1.4386957014910693
elizabeth could not but look surprised	2.3423561749240465
are you much acquainted with mr darcy	1.4330585425788942
"as much as i ever wish to be " cried elizabeth warmly "i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable	3.290344562312668
"i have no right to give my opinion " said wickham "as to his being agreeable or otherwise	2.6602083721369008
i am not qualified to form one	2.5201074663361
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge	2.9087558058945047
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else	2.8752705984917806
here you are in your own family	2.2309801097499284
"upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield	2.8369205174043852
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire	2.3234951758048887
every body is disgusted with his pride	2.6022618401861775
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one	2.6154897721402404
"i cannot pretend to be sorry " said wickham after a short interruption "that he or that any man should not be <unk> beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen	2.610157215682537
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and <unk> manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen	2.5065262431589623
wickham only shook his head	1.1683609605367116
"i wonder " said he at the next opportunity of speaking "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer	3.3078483734066055
"i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield	3.29422813705793
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood	2.8330051895662827
no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy	2.274822290130762
his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever <unk> and the <unk> friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections	2.1187853261287715
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	2.62948676374264
mr wickham began to speak on more general <unk> meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry	2.610157215682537
"it was the prospect of constant society and good society " he added "which was my chief inducement to enter the shire	2.53753776635983
i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them	2.610157215682537
society i own is necessary to me	1.704290893007969
i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude	2.684770007264579
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible	2.5471898340445245
the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now	2.321954250288982
"yes the late mr darcy <unk> me the next presentation of the best living in his <unk>	2.8230461595395724
he was my <unk> and excessively attached to me	2.0264781734303154
i cannot do justice to his kindness	1.8062481402012414
he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere	3.147416184149484
cried elizabeth "but how could that be	1.9794413553880525
why did not you seek legal <unk>	1.8373217890385503
"there was just such an <unk> in the terms of the <unk> as to give me no hope from law	3.8374191181871504
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <unk> recommendation and to assert that i had <unk> all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing	2.1187853261287715
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it	1.968419447286612
i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely	2.9688204724245733
i can recal nothing worse	1.3475766778991054
but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me	2.669298035579269
he deserves to be publicly <unk>	1.6511313215933607
till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him	2.2961676779941524
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them	2.4259523366436118
"but what " said she after a pause "can have been his motive	2.744850999430585
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly	2.484385770661609
had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father's uncommon attachment to me <unk> him i believe very early in life	2.6603538846236763
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me	2.857508494176065
"i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such <unk> as this	1.8957356524063758
his disposition must be dreadful	1.580126893100307
she could have added "a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being <unk> but she contented herself with "and one too who had probably been his own companion from <unk> connected together as i think you said in the closest manner	2.085205857248754
"we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together <unk> of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same <unk> care	2.6826957952797255
my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property	2.1187853261287715
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate <unk> friend	2.4369302285870686
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active <unk> and when immediately before my father's death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself	1.8529220216409523
i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you	2.49106925856921
"it is wonderful " replied wickham "for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend	2.3634435449185505
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling	2.043461451426372
but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger <unk> even than pride	2.751602873536743
"can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good	2.017546453545923
it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor	2.4372078949486125
family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this	2.7212784993351935
not to appear to disgrace his family to <unk> from the <unk> qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive	2.678817703431999
he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful <unk> of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers	2.543345761304649
"what sort of a girl is miss darcy	2.189779432216972
he shook his head	1.053087297425356
"i wish i could call her amiable	1.9922721552667415
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy	2.2181934373668457
as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement	2.6465934101938675
but she is nothing to me now	2.7461718362700758
she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished	2.4098019766208596
since her father's death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and <unk> her education	2.7701036061490076
after many pauses and many <unk> of other subjects elizabeth could not help <unk> once more to the first and saying "i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley	3.0247323123850194
how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man	2.631987888122641
how can they suit each other	1.4313974590500793
do you know mr bingley	1.815592751236305
"he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man	1.9292497437842113
he cannot know what mr darcy is	1.9246253065669814
<unk> not but mr darcy can please where he chuses	2.230743825764725
he does not want abilities	2.3425729547019882
among those who are at all his <unk> in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous	3.4538941770986926
his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure	2.335324827011979
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	2.3216813366971887
it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy	1.9187520990478337
"i know very well madam " said he "that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five <unk> any object	2.3713737056616555
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of <unk> little matters	2.7247311106732686
mr wickham's attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh	2.527540797968362
"lady catherine de bourgh " she replied "has very lately given him a living	2.588994231039995
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long	3.204417681447312
"you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy	2.7070293777274204
"no indeed i did not	1.4770775368548492
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday	2.576933056379836
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley	2.2956551140675
vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already self destined to another	2.6642651824396633
"mr collins " said she <unk> highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude <unk> him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an <unk> conceited woman	2.1187853261287715
"i believe her to be both in a great degree " replied wickham "i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were <unk> and insolent	2.4244620170823286
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she <unk> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class	1.8738174228603839
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham's attentions	2.3713737056616555
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philips's supper party but his manners recommended him to every body	2.620896485434046
elizabeth went away with her head full of him	2.146298137102114
she could think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent	2.192345972483447
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his <unk> at whist enumerating all the <unk> at supper and repeatedly fearing that he <unk> his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	1.6050163175336876
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr wickham and herself	2.8094429219996933
jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley's regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham	2.154434690031884
"they have both " said she <unk> deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea	3.04284360303732
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other	1.8326962633444162
it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <unk> them without actual blame on either side	2.344419184615673
"very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business	2.728004869465329
do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody	2.5919503088251137
<unk> as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion	2.816406833401397
my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be <unk> his father's favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for	2.761699813343848
no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it	2.4326326263078744
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him	2.0909114324586433
if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it	2.258158570775266
besides there was truth in his looks	1.9034177670831878
"it is difficult indeed it is distressing	1.8961718974230144
one does not know what to think	2.0478944577119362
"i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think	1.8780726529894336
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday	1.9187520990478337
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation	2.8061504399781936
they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet's civilities	2.485694318183821
mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card	2.5730862310236193
jane <unk> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy's looks and behaviour	2.085205857248754
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it	2.7287866596688106
"while i can have my mornings to myself " said she "it is enough	2.5922128915919416
i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	2.503982300956583
society has claims on us all and i <unk> myself one of those who consider intervals of <unk> and amusement as desirable for every body	3.0783951596780685
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak <unk> to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley's invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from <unk> a <unk> either from the <unk> or lady catherine de bourgh by <unk> to dance	1.4942339672143998
"i am by no means of opinion i assure you " said he "that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her	1.4030037231905736
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	1.7444980631874405
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins instead	2.3912923103251487
her liveliness had been never worse <unk>	1.6786701679706055
there was no help for it however	2.516668076290127
mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr collins's proposal accepted with as good a <unk> as she could	2.764991301985333
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more	2.9085452718145275
it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors	2.4244620170823286
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities <unk> herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her	1.7455628235338618
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply	2.7349737367784703
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a <unk> of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once	1.8738174228603839
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a <unk> saturday sunday and monday <unk> to kitty and lydia	2.1187853261287715
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the <unk> of red <unk> there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	2.761699813343848
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <unk> have alarmed her	3.0099744156131236
she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <unk> of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening	2.321954250288982
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <unk> for mr darcy's pleasure in the <unk> invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile "i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	1.4030037231905736
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly <unk> even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked her	2.610157215682537
the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification	2.0207049948691047
mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	2.3025158450224783
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy	2.145252435716859
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked	3.1066715232475848
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him	2.085205857248754
he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her	2.825633259442146
"i dare say you will find him very agreeable	2.458525478960218
that would be the greatest misfortune of all	2.5128094256731948
to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate	2.1931340626794946
do not wish me such an evil	1.787619418894234
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her <unk> looks their equal amazement in beholding it	2.321954250288982
he replied and was again silent	1.7533641827700184
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with "it is your turn to say something now mr darcy	2.5204584505523386
i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of <unk>	2.8658735380750513
that reply will do for the present	1.8987782305607854
but now we may be silent	1.7260296961767645
"do you talk by rule then while you are dancing	1.9519728412134298
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible	2.4244620170823286
"are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine	2.843889155374748
<unk> " replied elizabeth archly "for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds	2.6452862546981013
we are each of an <unk> <unk> disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will <unk> the whole room and be handed down to <unk> with all the <unk> of a <unk>	2.610157215682537
"this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure " said he	2.680931783036066
"how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say	2.3701079477122473
you think it a faithful <unk> undoubtedly	2.270885558343548
"i must not decide on my own performance	1.9187648793799104
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton	2.93315432838207
she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added "when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance	2.9114118067199697
the effect was immediate	1.3058724465143143
at length darcy spoke and in a <unk> manner said "mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain	2.5957130990401596
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he <unk> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner	2.154434690031884
"i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir	2.555335514810356
such very superior dancing is not often seen	1.913382609361517
it is evident that you belong to the first <unk>	2.0528292195459077
allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place	2.232735148777284
what congratulations will then flow in	1.5922906494693434
i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir	3.0226897326807114
you will not thank me for detaining you from the <unk> converse of that young lady whose <unk> eyes are also <unk> me	2.8101247069040545
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together	2.321954250288982
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said "sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	2.3371293778941076
"i do not think we were speaking at all	2.8795002013446025
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves	2.936620466244704
we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine	2.656099504831443
"what think you of books	1.5620753204186102
we may <unk> our different opinions	1.7204497904218357
"no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else	2.3732539241866055
"the present always <unk> you in such scenes does it	2.2347272979123023
said he with a look of doubt	1.8755054500509398
"yes always " she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming "i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever <unk> that your resentment once created was <unk>	2.085205857248754
you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created	2.469184236824417
"i am " said he with a firm voice	2.384271287792235
"and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice	1.7901872889229478
"it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at <unk> "may i ask to what these questions <unk>	2.3298301662074277
<unk> to the illustration of your character " said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity	3.0482333133222737
"i am trying to make it out	1.7034923140333995
"and what is your success	2.1809614165007507
she shook her head	1.0383973775914677
"i do not get on at all	2.714610834548031
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly	1.922935151194334
"i can readily believe " answered he gravely "that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either	1.9952623149688797
"but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity	2.867323042184159
"i would by no means <unk> any pleasure of yours " he coldly replied	2.280364971775418
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another	2.023589647725157
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her "so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham	2.5390111419678663
your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcy's steward	2.232735148777284
let me recommend you however as a friend not to give <unk> confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcy's using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner	1.9187520990478337
i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way	1.715437896342879
i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your <unk> guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better	2.5300303940883557
"his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same " said elizabeth <unk> "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy's steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself	2.085205857248754
"i beg your pardon " replied miss bingley turning away with a <unk>	2.1898955688307185
it was kindly meant	1.213553066098656
said elizabeth to herself	1.3828600474473152
"you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this	2.261972786082463
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy	2.2714415619573165
she then sought her eldest sister who had <unk> to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley	2.818928812753594
"i want to know " said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's "what you have learnt about mr wickham	2.967506884751003
"no " replied jane "i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you	3.2968177472710978
mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the <unk> and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man	1.5237960002208242
"mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself	2.1588083885575102
"no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton	2.2821994328801964
"this account then is what he has received from mr darcy	2.3185112207515584
i am perfectly satisfied	1.0725046896088335
"i have not a doubt of mr bingley's sincerity " said elizabeth warmly "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only	3.125784361494377
mr bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is <unk> with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before	2.085205857248754
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment	2.3670244173467467
on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great <unk> that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery	1.8957356524063758
"i have found out " said he "by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness	2.998341809109952
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine	2.848035868435802
how wonderfully these sort of things occur	1.745206785099699
who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly	2.5312838630092327
i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before	2.543345761304649
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology	1.8838297790110243
"you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy	2.137198473960159
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	1.9266589569165165
i believe him to be lady catherine's nephew	2.9502344353266645
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night	2.8246985716074073
elizabeth tried hard to <unk> him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance	1.6618362775387496
you must therefore allow me to follow the <unk> of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty	3.290344562312668
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and <unk> study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself	2.085205857248754
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his <unk> she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident	2.963722651837137
her cousin <unk> his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the <unk> of his lips the words <unk> " <unk> " and "lady catherine de bourgh	2.154434690031884
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man	2.828857685516354
mr darcy was <unk> him with <unk> wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility	2.9909432118199084
mr collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way	2.3713737056616555
mr collins then returned to elizabeth	1.6004506147385045
"i have no reason i assure you " said he "to be dissatisfied with my reception	2.88051105698178
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention	2.086330169669066
he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <unk>	2.610157215682537
it was really a very handsome thought	2.2396569250425022
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the <unk> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane	2.192345972483447
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters	2.543345761304649
her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much	2.379722081282963
when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley	1.79571449437164
it was an <unk> subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match	2.270184545231687
his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	1.8329807108324359
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and <unk> it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <unk> her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	1.701254279852589
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life	2.321954250288982
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it	2.473267109069098
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <unk> whisper for to her <unk> vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them	2.053525026457146
her mother only <unk> her for being nonsensical	2.1098033696759924
"what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him	3.0405026221310583
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear	3.4116604139781477
"for heaven's sake madam speak lower	1.5613637001267584
nothing that she could say however had any influence	2.9298517856249475
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation	1.7364738419269383
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity	2.383876843734766
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long <unk> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold <unk> and <unk>	2.3713737056616555
elizabeth now began to <unk>	1.416321576500064
but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company	2.63355435899651
by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of <unk> was delightful to her and she began her song	2.4244620170823286
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several <unk> with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another	1.715437896342879
<unk> powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected	2.7048342271608874
elizabeth was in <unk>	1.3916370960206652
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley	2.8032539413518975
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making <unk> of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave	2.618269177537635
she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night	2.626182364715547
he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud "that will do extremely well child	2.3199880184781665
let the other young ladies have time to <unk>	2.1713558047966646
mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father's speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good	2.5429496574924944
others of the party were now applied to	2.3666212074595747
"if i " said mr collins "were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman	2.053525026457146
i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <unk> too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to	2.9253215058983435
the rector of a parish has much to do	2.058018545287556
in the first place he must make such an agreement for <unk> as may be <unk> to himself and not offensive to his patron	3.2330540913745436
he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible	2.4244620170823286
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <unk> manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment	2.927713991502731
i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should <unk> an occasion of <unk> his respect towards any body connected with the family	2.843626845564204
and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room	3.4096591429439633
that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of <unk> her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	2.2758459260747883
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement	2.3590858728019652
she was teazed by mr collins who continued most <unk> by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others	2.610157215682537
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	2.621927133593456
there was no <unk> upon such a project	2.5770273473880456
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy's farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak	2.782854388252489
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her <unk> to mr wickham and rejoiced in it	3.7028515682628065
they <unk> every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a <unk> over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was <unk> mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <unk>	1.79571449437164
darcy said nothing at all	1.3233767809961765
mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene	1.917716388540933
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other	2.6009008892638477
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of <unk> how tired i am	2.667360736895008
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most <unk> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation	1.8139306939110624
bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time	2.610157215682537
of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure	2.604073587057806
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was <unk> by mr bingley and netherfield	2.6826957952797255
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn	2.386687290165443
mr collins made his declaration in form	1.6540601423797678
having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very <unk> manner with all the <unk> which he supposed a regular part of the business	1.8139306939110624
on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words "may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning	1.9429496147158305
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs bennet instantly answered "oh dear	2.590013665556177
i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection	3.3521150574178993
come kitty i want you up stairs	1.728923614063607
and <unk> her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out "dear ma'am do not go	2.4917309238821717
mr collins must excuse me	1.3874021797342277
he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear	3.004414098492178
i am going away myself	1.981877586039488
"no no nonsense lizzy	1.2133876077849108
i desire you will stay where you are	1.797382549644288
and upon elizabeth's seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added "lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins	2.1470723121914133
mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins began	2.6989124518835457
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother's permission for this address	2.921394714548524
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life	2.6705660706304037
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of <unk> a wife as i certainly did	2.232735148777284
the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued "my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish	1.615598098439874
secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness	2.192345972483447
on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our <unk> at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh's foot <unk> that she said <unk> collins you must marry	2.4816289228368253
a clergyman like you must marry	1.673470482110277
chuse properly chuse a <unk> for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way	2.610157215682537
this is my advice	1.3544099990923621
find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her	2.914740214777619
allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not <unk> the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer	2.610157215682537
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will <unk> excite	2.543345761304649
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women	2.543345761304649
but the fact is that being as i am to <unk> this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years	1.615598098439874
this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem	2.9528380731376243
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection	2.80727802885315
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease is all that you may ever be entitled to	2.7400164766660695
on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	2.812607152055124
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	1.728018364730262
"you are too hasty sir " she cried	2.06646883737631
"you forget that i have made no answer	2.3101228206272433
let me do it without farther loss of time	1.9725319698431953
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me	2.088641054443886
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time	2.444410860460873
you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so	4.181236270142575
nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation	2.955782910813876
"were it certain that lady catherine would think so " said mr collins very gravely "but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <unk> of you	3.052175985830789
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications	2.980859939822499
"indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary	2.042313541504379
you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say	2.359219989774228
i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise	2.759992689967036
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach	2.785715358556467
this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled	1.7817700334486042
and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus addressed her "when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from <unk> you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character	1.3938972755249328
<unk> mr collins " cried elizabeth with some warmth "you puzzle me exceedingly	2.5654292418111755
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one	2.6826957952797255
"you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	2.350048550735698
my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable	2.6826957952797255
my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <unk> attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you	1.8738174228603839
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications	2.475277234996027
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females	2.4816289228368253
"i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which <unk> in <unk> a respectable man	3.2038923652554905
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible	2.6961415008512883
my feelings in every respect forbid it	1.9703632528021089
can i speak <unk>	1.3207460255736314
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart	2.405101065682998
"you are uniformly charming	1.1986144635594183
cried he with an air of awkward gallantry "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable	2.5852934669540777
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs bennet having <unk> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection	1.6378937069540642
mr collins received and returned these <unk> with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <unk> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	1.8139306939110624
this information however startled mrs bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so	2.321954250288982
"but depend upon it mr collins " she added "that lizzy shall be brought to reason	2.3558681205278025
she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it	3.236104024227035
if therefore she actually <unk> in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity	2.610157215682537
"sir you quite misunderstand me " said mrs bennet alarmed	2.4251413133579924
"lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these	1.6117393030423226
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived	2.5946648594155057
i will go directly to mr bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure	2.9501097443921083
she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library "oh	3.100153739540603
mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an <unk>	2.467957388738408
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she <unk> she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her	2.848035868435802
"i have not the pleasure of understanding you " said he when she had finished her speech	3.1725187544520908
"of what are you talking	1.6323498225565343
"of mr collins and lizzy	2.391102651048968
lizzy <unk> she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy	3.812246709501438
<unk> to lizzy about it yourself	1.6504095253041244
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him	2.019199478616975
"let her be called down	1.557095996833633
she shall hear my opinion	1.5438973271656273
mrs bennet <unk> the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library	2.4177345919805684
"come here child " cried her father as she appeared	2.3844613719406027
"i have sent for you on an affair of importance	2.013389879324422
elizabeth replied that it was	1.417004054954648
"very well and this offer of marriage you have refused	2.234577992544553
we now come to the point	1.4982161664392946
your mother <unk> upon your accepting it	1.8112131835551895
"yes or i will never see her again	2.1037220191289117
"an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth	1.6858463463151654
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do	2.3218375846408446
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	2.942727176209282
"my dear " replied her husband "i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room	2.761699813343848
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be	3.4503512353252805
she talked to elizabeth again and again <unk> and <unk> her by turns	3.6454388054184226
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined <unk> and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	2.7752295766730257
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	1.6829609951060034
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way	2.445071718328114
his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret	2.5699939571244235
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them	2.574766957371077
she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper "i am glad you are come for there is such fun here	2.4212512777560775
what do you think has happened this morning	2.2081856773722763
mr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him	2.3582250422786104
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and <unk> her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	1.715437896342879
"aye there she comes " continued mrs bennet <unk> as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at <unk> provided she can have her own way	2.7699707976617898
but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to <unk> you when your father is dead	1.968419447286612
i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you	3.080157724223289
i have done with you from this very day	2.3659342083965185
i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word	3.6006546410539624
i have no pleasure in talking to <unk> children	2.779586862017355
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking	2.494414382079751
but it is always so	2.5714023746306642
those who do not complain are never pitied	1.8580277617667096
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or <unk> her would only increase the irritation	2.3045581538356306
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls "now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your <unk> and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together	1.7782794100389228
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear	1.7615770326037883
in a <unk> voice mrs bennet thus began the <unk> conversation	2.3908623573341
"my dear madam " replied he "let us be for ever silent on this point	2.415038347621943
far be it from me " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure "to resent the behaviour of your daughter	2.433283238451622
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned	2.6826957952797255
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	2.053525026457146
you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus <unk> my pretensions to your daughter's favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to <unk> your authority in my behalf	2.154434690031884
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my <unk> from your daughter's lips instead of your own	2.2332375659679085
but we are all liable to error	2.097672798347953
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair	2.1092108955645856
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise	2.5511398915116863
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	2.6184159581414646
he scarcely ever spoke to her and the <unk> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were <unk> for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a <unk> relief to them all and especially to her friend	2.085205857248754
the morrow produced no <unk> of mrs bennet's ill humour or ill health	2.501582390799703
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride	3.0862488543619664
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <unk> his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	2.863572054962036
he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	2.4735537059243606
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball	2.598304959437221
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over	2.7824439143960413
to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed	2.557704161682441
"i found " said he "as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself	1.9429496147158305
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately	2.3669436436100124
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady's fair <unk> hand and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	2.4244620170823286
when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said "this is from caroline bingley what it <unk> has surprised me a good deal	2.648050408906637
the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again	2.982797488466751
you shall hear what she says	1.7963802796780415
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a house	2.3713737056616555
the next was in these words	1.7516832844635954
"i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence	1.8329807108324359
i depend on you for that	1.8888251128743485
to these high <unk> expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the <unk> of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley's being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his	1.6265507027536246
"it is unlucky " said she after a short pause "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country	2.838337977982782
"caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter	2.4234522594354795
i will read it to you "when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles <unk> to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <unk> <unk>	1.5160826983319609
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the <unk> but of that i <unk>	2.761699813343848
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may <unk> in the gaieties which that season generally <unk> and that your <unk> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall <unk> you	2.321954250288982
"it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should	2.2223768877970596
"why will you think so	1.7911251783197208
it must be his own doing	2.7149103098391953
but you do not know all	2.5250364960810034
i will read you the passage which particularly <unk> me	2.0284159332599057
i will have no reserves from you	1.8884380071107
"mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again	2.794661463890066
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she <unk> in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister	2.192345972483447
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable	2.6826957952797255
my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister's partiality is not <unk> me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart	1.9429496147158305
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in <unk> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many	2.761699813343848
"what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy	1.9856684980036927
said jane as she finished it	2.097554072930984
to put me on my guard	1.7462684187073176
can there be any other opinion on the subject	2.065038509422451
"yes there can for mine is totally different	1.80472083970933
will you hear it	1.214600522521614
"you shall have it in few words	1.939321268131891
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy	2.75173553632042
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and <unk> to persuade you that he does not care about you	3.139255241656719
jane shook her head	1.0383973775914677
"indeed jane you ought to believe me	2.006933073991434
no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection	2.0839466640163455
miss bingley i am sure cannot	2.6149101304403954
she is not such a simpleton	2.5158449290628955
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes	2.927647828589173
but the case is this	1.5881044433543037
we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one <unk> she may have less trouble in <unk> a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way	1.701254279852589
but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley <unk> you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend	1.6618362775387496
but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully <unk> any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself	2.9185019323254013
believe her to be deceived by all means	2.3146038394096236
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer	2.401672999888193
"but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere	2.8950058890750827
"how can you talk so	1.5971746962981093
said jane <unk> smiling "you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate	3.027552399691446
"i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion	2.8189562025331516
"but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required	2.292036451963084
a thousand things may arise in six months	1.7150589777785727
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt	2.6920602668516
it appeared to her merely the <unk> of caroline's interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or <unk> spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one	2.4816289228368253
jane's temper was not <unk> and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	2.761699813343848
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she <unk> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together	1.7782794100389228
after <unk> it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses	1.8738174228603839
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins	2.8731026506491935
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	2.014696442292821
"it keeps him in good humour " said she "and i am more obliged to you than i can express	2.9857772944326397
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	2.7604306623279515
this was very amiable but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any <unk> of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr collins's addresses by engaging them towards herself	2.610157215682537
such was miss lucas's scheme and <unk> were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	2.6826957952797255
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and <unk> to lucas lodge to throw himself at her <unk>	2.3713737056616555
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively <unk> since the adventure of wednesday	1.6744824380115346
his reception however was of the most flattering kind	2.4744360512295716
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	2.648958486554279
in as short a time as mr collins's long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be <unk> for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	1.6744824380115346
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity	2.8618626487991103
mr collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair	2.5173479257842386
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st james's	1.701254279852589
the whole family in short were properly <unk> on the occasion	2.342862264108643
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's dying an old maid	2.478893244009985
charlotte herself was tolerably composed	1.4782501090527782
she had gained her point and had time to consider of it	2.2606511922882624
her reflections were in general satisfactory	1.9303934405705716
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	2.6432876856746863
but still he would be her husband	1.9516568042997953
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want	2.2758459260747883
this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it	2.584149278094591
elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation	2.647747806544463
she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore <unk> mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	2.848035868435802
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to <unk> and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to <unk> his prosperous love	1.7455628235338618
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them	1.7455628235338618
"my dear madam " he replied "this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall <unk> myself of it as soon as possible	2.4816289228368253
they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said "but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here my good sir	2.848035868435802
you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness	2.215931715131509
"my dear sir " replied mr collins "i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence	2.6942212272936894
risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence	2.321954250288982
"believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire	2.154434690031884
as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth	2.761699813343848
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return	2.3552179999477976
mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	3.118414267615209
but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away	2.6440383432804437
miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before	2.7371594896662925
the possibility of mr collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <unk> of decorum and she could not help crying out <unk> to mr collins	1.6496480740980204
my dear charlotte impossible	1.6114519300277537
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon <unk> her composure and <unk> replied "why should you be surprised my dear eliza	1.9952623149688797
do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to <unk> any woman's good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you	3.2120732192575994
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable <unk> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness	2.3713737056616555
"i see what you are feeling " replied charlotte "you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you	2.8437628683313574
but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done	3.6312491033790777
i am not <unk> you know	2.9841483682633494
i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collins's character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state	2.4244620170823286
elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly " and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family	2.33533051411011
charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard	2.625886648736052
the <unk> of mr collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted	3.2133122843332194
she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <unk> she would have <unk> every better feeling to worldly advantage	2.4816289228368253
charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating picture	2.7457486656524552
with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil <unk> exclaimed "good lord	1.8738174228603839
do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy	3.0841544330550614
nothing less than the complaisance of a <unk> could have borne without anger such treatment but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most <unk> courtesy	1.968419447286612
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to <unk> his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london	1.4440241885954521
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent	3.0214987474310626
in the first place she persisted in <unk> the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and <unk> that the match might be broken off	2.192345972483447
nothing could console and nothing <unk> her	1.7499267826106293
nor did that day <unk> out her resentment	1.9514970195189172
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	2.321954250288982
mr bennet's <unk> were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter	1.8329807108324359
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	2.681871223984275
kitty and lydia were far from <unk> miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton	2.761699813343848
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <unk> on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs bennet's <unk> looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away	1.8529220216409523
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <unk> silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <unk> between them again	3.109224601804713
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose <unk> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	1.968419447286612
the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a <unk> abode in the family might have <unk>	2.7763101360741618
mr collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet	2.372972911751308
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband	3.138619451400004
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <unk>	2.8377119331410245
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable	2.3672930024748076
such were the gentle <unk> of mrs bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley's continued absence	2.9955305905651253
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	1.7736953997838383
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	2.681642046594671
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so <unk> of jane's happiness and so dishonourable to the <unk> of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring	3.290344562312668
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <unk> friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment	2.543345761304649
as for jane her anxiety under this <unk> was of course more painful than elizabeth's but whatever she felt she was desirous of <unk> and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to	2.610157215682537
it needed all jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity	1.9383427399008084
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction	2.862996591261737
he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company	2.808253792467928
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state	2.9930999827740106
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her	2.3943450871012053
as her <unk> in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence	2.3659569413959503
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead	1.8529220216409523
she <unk> bitterly of all this to her husband	2.3997612391054832
"indeed mr bennet " said she "it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it	2.2758459260747883
let us hope for better things	1.6916212622589872
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the <unk>	2.2655198378716785
"what should not you mind	1.9102153274159064
"i should not mind any thing at all	2.0956447574796186
"let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility	2.780988847188253
"i never can be thankful mr bennet for any thing about the entail	2.6206334649657705
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too	2.827066289601371
why should he have it more than anybody else	2.203341395422148
"i leave it to yourself to determine " said mr bennet	2.037077223359325
illustration a <unk> house	1.411499483938261

egerton military library whitehall	1.0361000504218256
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country	2.2758459260747883
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort	2.7821396436395243
miss darcy's praise occupied the chief of it	1.652322449139659
her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted <unk> of their increasing intimacy and ventured to <unk> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter	2.868903391581414
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an <unk> of mr darcy's house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture	2.9686420637164117
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation	2.718534442072658
that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <unk> friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations	1.6378937069540642
had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sister's was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself	2.3713737056616555
it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing	2.720304281848033
she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away or were suppressed by his <unk> interference whether he had been aware of jane's attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sister's situation remained the same her peace equally wounded	1.7301957388458942
that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	2.613225094194254
but i will not repine	2.227180339056311
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing	2.3265330153667425
"you doubt me " cried jane slightly colouring "indeed you have no reason	2.4318751852128293
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all	2.828539547347881
i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with	2.4241969169129263
i have not that pain	2.7316047587515744
i shall certainly try to get the better	1.9264090360058046
with a stronger voice she soon added "i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself	2.4816289228368253
exclaimed elizabeth "you are too good	1.9569300468679816
your sweetness and <unk> are really <unk> i do not know what to say to you	2.533167080100044
miss bennet eagerly <unk> all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection	2.1995232118200225
"nay " said elizabeth "this is not fair	2.9219127515155323
i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it	2.122324568435569
do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my <unk> on your privilege of universal good will	2.9551170752807816
there are few people whom i really love and still <unk> of whom i think well	2.6705381428292854
the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day <unk> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense	2.192345972483447
i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte's marriage	2.7116665317475004
in every view it is unaccountable	1.6501810398551366
"my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these	2.4493811429749726
they will ruin your happiness	1.349048414996075
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper	2.5284274637046393
consider mr collins's respectability and charlotte's prudent steady character	1.7813287098100272
remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every body's sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin	2.3713737056616555
"to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart	1.9952623149688797
you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas	2.8248188816274316
you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that <unk> is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness	2.6374512122704927
but enough of this	1.3668989519065138
you alluded to something else	1.496804075961312
you mentioned two instances	1.2249497143623511
i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk	2.5522431719791596
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured	2.568857566885333
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <unk>	2.8935202919634633
women fancy admiration means more than it does	1.8192867637504848
"and men take care that they should	1.7496244192703303
"if it is <unk> done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine	3.2502821612133914
"i am far from <unk> any part of mr bingley's conduct to design " said elizabeth "but without <unk> to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery	2.610157215682537
thoughtlessness want of attention to other people's feelings and want of resolution will do the business	2.3341618672944437
"and do you <unk> it to either of those	2.797121861766937
"yes to the last but if i go on i shall <unk> you by saying what i think of persons you esteem	3.0757531175654313
stop me whilst you can	1.3637280977705784
"you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	1.9128954095334114
"yes in <unk> with his friend	2.3101478699490463
"i cannot believe it	1.246396458227227
why should they try to influence him	1.5962990393330994
they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it	2.7038124608943495
"your first <unk> is false	1.6733281115741125
they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride	2.610157215682537
<unk> a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy " replied jane "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing	2.6858657712305285
they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better	2.56298358759406
but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's	2.7251710386360477
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable	2.464338577293796
if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed	2.697102141988871
by supposing such an affection you make every body acting <unk> and wrong and me most unhappy	2.286850574606185
do not distress me by the idea	1.9121625485856226
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	2.942727176209282
let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood	3.0113643383480535
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	3.2525416946229937
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity	2.3713737056616555
mrs bennet's best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer	2.400436234092677
mr bennet treated the matter differently	1.648629262872237
"so lizzy " said he one day "your sister is crossed in love i find	2.8319864550066995
next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then	2.1996320844716086
it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions	2.6957249824082226
when is your turn to come	1.6226529719106417
you will hardly bear to be long <unk> by jane	2.2820335591152276
now is your time	1.3859803418866232
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	2.188842462287477
he is a pleasant fellow and would <unk> you <unk>	2.8985108950356717
"thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me	2.221767835200228
we must not all expect jane's good fortune	2.3038199078043005
mr wickham's society was of material service in <unk> the gloom which the late <unk> occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family	2.5435840535503393
they saw him often and to his other <unk> was now added that of general <unk>	2.7315857333155975
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter	1.9429496147158305
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <unk> circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her <unk> and steady candour always <unk> for <unk> and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men	1.9429496147158305
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday	2.6667366277668383
the pain of separation however might be <unk> on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men	2.085205857248754
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks	2.4646604151982783
on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn	3.194980273829078
mr gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education	2.685866204696031
mrs gardiner who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces	2.9485677260165306
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard	2.3102054933907414
they had frequently been staying with her in town	2.2252132293953233
the first part of mrs gardiner's business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the <unk> fashions	2.402262242869036
when this was done she had a less active part to play	2.491714483150606
it became her turn to listen	1.703762348527342
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of	2.387315526799813
they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister	2.2986847602947096
"i do not blame jane " she continued "for jane would have got mr bingley if she could	3.170238140008819
he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him	2.3346537415233932
the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever	3.005954530120258
the lucases are very <unk> people indeed sister	2.006648480070065
they are all for what they can get	2.46979907828075
i am sorry to say it of them but so it is	2.3653150289815184
it makes me very nervous and poorly to be <unk> so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else	2.9747456294493815
however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long <unk>	2.8456649892631782
mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	2.4816289228368253
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject	2.0444090510189414
"i am sorry it went off	2.0193266714328586
but these things happen so often	1.5581679904948826
a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident <unk> them so easily <unk> her that these sort of <unk> are very frequent	2.4244620170823286
"an excellent consolation in its way " said elizabeth "but it will not do for us	2.6863916260340845
we do not suffer by accident	2.1387867068629083
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before	2.543345761304649
"but that expression of <unk> in <unk> is so <unk> so doubtful so <unk> that it gives me very little idea	3.38864012604243
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour's acquaintance as to a real strong attachment	2.37018577401717
"i never saw a more promising inclination	2.0414027780150152
he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her	1.8091930571903088
every time they met it was more decided and remarkable	2.3947163539587
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer	2.6440887860773223
could there be finer symptoms	1.6154498580005903
is not general incivility the very <unk> of love	1.9954127340881649
i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately	2.751069333375144
it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner	2.9380235459447577
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us	2.6874582475332423
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister's ready <unk>	2.4797213626716084
"i hope " added mrs gardiner "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her	2.4404379103545137
we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her	2.2758459260747883
"and that is quite impossible for he is now in the <unk> of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london	2.848035868435802
my dear aunt how could you think of it	2.674747822287212
mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a <unk> <unk> enough to <unk> him from its <unk> were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never <unk> without him	2.192345972483447
i hope they will not meet at all	1.947501952068916
but does not jane <unk> with the sister	2.5916634038876962
she will not be able to help calling	3.041752630242278
"she will drop the acquaintance entirely	1.597873875142169
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless	2.023589647725157
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends <unk> <unk> by the more natural influence of jane's attractions	2.942727176209282
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him	1.9952623149688797
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement	3.079395581138637
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner	2.739984660308167
when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered <unk> by elizabeth's warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both	2.232735148777284
without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment	1.9429496147158305
about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged	2.7500099776736366
they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father five years before it was yet in his power to give her <unk> intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring	2.085205857248754
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well	2.5475572894422656
here consequently was an <unk> subject of discourse	1.8604000293219578
in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in <unk> her <unk> of praise on the character of its late possessor she was <unk> both him and herself	2.6826957952797255
on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy's treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a <unk> which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy	1.8957356524063758
mrs gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on "you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are <unk> against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly	1.8139306939110624
seriously i would have you be on your guard	2.3151492110986616
do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent	2.5465179333661845
but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you	2.622756617643931
you have sense and we all expect you to use it	2.1834418006623455
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure	2.104302997145843
you must not disappoint your father	1.9641412894655228
"yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise	3.0509632711544317
<unk> you are not serious now	2.2078785200793636
"i beg your pardon	1.0089094719423393
at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not	3.411440780600819
but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not	3.046989570903508
i see the imprudence of it	1.7286548671552815
that abominable mr darcy	1.1319192098729558
my father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to <unk> it	2.857394208264013
my father however is partial to mr wickham	1.8343486079813176
in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be <unk> than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be <unk> to resist	1.539926526059492
all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry	3.175466523767267
when i am in company with him i will not be wishing	3.3736701258484403
in short i will do my <unk> "perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often	2.8259640932942336
at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him	2.108188384511941
"as i did the other day " said elizabeth with a conscious smile "very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that	2.9895501675295706
but do not imagine that he is always here so often	2.952688210645917
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week	2.7836104056155446
you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends	2.9687349253046453
but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied	2.741293485905685
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented	2.761699813343848
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet	2.6826957952797255
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy	2.543345761304649
thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room	2.232735148777284
as they went down stairs together charlotte said "i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	2.4833226737848006
" that you certainly shall	1.6171250004248687
"and i have another favour to ask	1.9942993761899201
will you come and see me	1.7927562562756423
"we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire	1.9963050390033612
"i am not likely to leave kent for some time	2.41914177161558
elizabeth could not refuse though she <unk> little pleasure in the visit	2.960969988755099
indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them	2.7743638170424956
the wedding took place the bride and <unk> set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual	2.942727176209282
elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	2.81629692783973
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to <unk> as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was	2.543345761304649
the house furniture neighbourhood and <unk> were all to her taste and lady catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging	2.47953362343069
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is	2.249156340221864
she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost "my aunt " she continued "is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street	2.053525026457146
"i did not think caroline in spirits " were her words "but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london	2.8835133375884414
i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her	2.027625030324611
he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him	3.059511121467663
i dare say i shall soon see them here	2.4479333464020048
elizabeth shook her head over this letter	1.890651064813665
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister's being in town	2.4226897792205895
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention	3.009138090030127
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and <unk> every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the <unk> of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer	2.1187853261287715
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt	2.7976734654289626
but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion	2.7120296623383773
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again	2.942727176209282
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time	2.4139036584031457
when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer	1.79571449437164
i pity though i cannot help blaming her	2.1437074084477343
she was very wrong in <unk> me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side	2.8696654554493453
but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it	3.0042581053151456
i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so <unk> dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable	1.9429496147158305
i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago	2.7234709616064494
he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy	2.3713737056616555
if i were not afraid of judging <unk> i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this	3.7568005680251213
let me hear from you very soon	2.0630325174728616
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty	2.459231361165116
we had better not mention it	1.863530767092861
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford	2.412297010135999
pray go to see them with sir william and maria	2.5536053430960464
i am sure you will be very comfortable there	3.5459307760559766
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions	2.92068477169617
his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcy's sister as by wickham's account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away	2.053525026457146
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	2.4033743620758776
his apparent partiality had <unk> his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else	2.702856508478908
elizabeth was <unk> enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain	3.141423284749463
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it	2.734464032015607
the sudden <unk> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now <unk> himself agreeable but elizabeth less clear <unk> perhaps in his case than in charlotte's did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	2.1187853261287715
nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <unk> her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy	2.232735148777284
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on "i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and <unk> passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil	1.8529220216409523
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king	2.206200085947219
i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl	3.3666518043823648
there can be no love in all this	2.1281692428171803
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly	1.6256717768463105
kitty and lydia take his <unk> much more to heart than i do	2.682562829902212
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford	1.9850676644304064
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty	2.543345761304649
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such <unk> sisters home could not be <unk> a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	2.923384737687846
the journey would moreover give her a <unk> at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay	2.9409585960643043
every thing however went on <unk> and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch	2.4089582801460536
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter	2.5913847869343893
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be	2.5239894957908935
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	2.321954250288982
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more	2.900609208204294
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment <unk> her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <unk> there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing	1.353876180022544
her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable	3.114568274587578
elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir william's too long	2.5536592310326918
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information	2.250171968941694
it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon	3.055556534590976
as they drove to mr gardiner's door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it <unk> and lovely as ever	2.154434690031884
on the stairs were a <unk> of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower	2.232735148777284
all was joy and kindness	1.3728075154679287
the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in <unk> and <unk> and the evening at one of the <unk>	3.1138383275170898
it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long	2.562247890177618
mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch street and repeated <unk> <unk> at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance	2.4816289228368253
"pray my dear aunt what is the difference in <unk> affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive	2.6412263489461916
where does discretion end and <unk> begin	1.7000680726033406
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary	2.4816289228368253
"she is a very good kind of girl i believe	2.428670177853476
i know no harm of her	1.3862780298484534
"no why should he	1.1532229267637117
"but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event	2.51342296620406
"a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant <unk> which other people may observe	2.4093316216028957
" her not objecting does not justify him	1.765860344322877
it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling	1.8841180991642414
"well " cried elizabeth "have it as you choose	2.7093042330132953
he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish	2.017222214842139
"no lizzy that is what i do not choose	3.084479818060401
i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	2.9455394222803792
if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better	2.7832529232945085
i am sick of them all	1.5567540860479003
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all	1.9261614849755684
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	2.610157215682537
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us " said mrs gardiner "but perhaps to the lakes	2.6319692826549073
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	2.826778498388902
"my dear dear aunt " she <unk> cried "what delight	2.455699644004009
you give me fresh life and <unk>	1.9252124285840546
adieu to disappointment and <unk>	1.3954945198177313
what are men to <unk> and mountains	2.3689878902276167
what hours of <unk> we shall spend	2.0636955353429984
and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one <unk> idea of any thing	2.8682396461013098
we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen	2.432472340502999
lakes mountains and <unk> shall not be <unk> together in our <unk> nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation	2.547945615462576
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers	2.1608664386012464
every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight	1.9429496147158305
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view	2.6248276609733154
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side	1.7186128754556083
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	2.7446041504338394
the garden <unk> to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the <unk> <unk> every thing declared they were <unk>	3.330519259373964
mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the <unk> and smiles of the whole party	2.6826957952797255
in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other	3.2762822568914984
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received	2.828266070793628
she saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	2.321954250288982
they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with <unk> formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment	1.968419447286612
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his <unk> and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	2.023589647725157
but though every thing seemed <unk> and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of <unk> and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion	2.3713737056616555
once or twice she could discern a <unk> blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear	2.553700011100002
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the <unk> of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible	2.4816289228368253
here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a <unk> which left beauty entirely behind	2.3790418007132894
he could number the <unk> in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant <unk>	2.9798829421073374
but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house	2.154434690031884
it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground	2.2515856185344014
from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two <unk> but the ladies not having <unk> to encounter the remains of a white <unk> turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help	1.79571449437164
it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit	2.669888690051529
when mr collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten	2.8595667806943847
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country	2.5088312377252335
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed "yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the <unk> sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her	2.085205857248754
she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over	2.6634806171600403
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here	2.5789177542993817
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming	2.4895616053742815
we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home	2.2831235237507244
her ladyship's carriage is <unk> ordered for us	1.9205440630682629
i should say one of her ladyship's carriages for she has several	2.547922579422726
"lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed " added charlotte "and a most attentive neighbour	2.5880564182168
"very true my dear that is exactly what i say	2.1028581085777907
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference	2.5906401336399907
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment to understand her address in <unk> and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well	1.7782794100389228
she had also to <unk> how her visit would pass the quiet <unk> of their usual employments the vexatious <unk> of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings	2.815386275535339
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her	1.9952623149688797
she opened the door and met maria in the <unk> place who breathless with agitation cried out "oh my dear eliza	2.643175408034683
pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen	2.651405223840638
make haste and come down this moment	1.840292225338347
"and is this all	1.3646589295247862
"i expected at least that the <unk> were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter	2.468011960427626
my dear " said maria quite shocked at the mistake "it is not lady catherine	2.2024261207662152
the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them	1.8963015038705375
the other is miss de bourgh	1.5268029316812324
only look at her	1.2261250953338763
she is quite a little creature	1.9196620525898855
who would have thought she could be so thin and small	2.7022334968715214
"she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this <unk>	2.3652011247899716
charlotte says she hardly ever does	1.7373492125344787
"i like her appearance " said elizabeth struck with other ideas	2.622629554730665
"she looks sickly and cross	1.3642722799447122
yes she will do for him very well	2.269461436014837
she will make him a very proper wife	2.271958480160926
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeth's high diversion was stationed in the <unk> in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly <unk> whenever miss de bourgh looked that way	2.154434690031884
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day	2.4816289228368253
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	1.7782794100389228
"i confess " said he "that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings	2.88684624637036
i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen	2.550788282837962
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this	2.8706167367169453
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival	2.83102277669796
about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	1.9080273478989118
mr collins was carefully <unk> them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly <unk> them	3.046989570903508
when the ladies were <unk> for the toilette he said to elizabeth "do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your <unk>	2.670475019784236
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter	1.9852582827061536
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more	2.8268536854548514
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being <unk> dressed	2.6191418017100747
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved	2.4256370087200514
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much <unk> to be kept waiting for her dinner	2.942727176209282
such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st james's	2.1187853261287715
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park	2.3716732892113304
every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to <unk> and was but slightly affected by his <unk> of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the <unk> altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh	1.7301957388458942
when they ascended the steps to the hall maria's alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm	2.262040909488776
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her <unk> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere <unk> of money and rank she thought she could witness without <unk>	2.848035868435802
from the entrance hall of which mr collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an <unk> chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sitting	2.321954250288982
in spite of having been at st james's sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look	1.7455628235338618
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly	2.369025601581814
lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked features which might once have been handsome	2.3837988051923658
she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self importance and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented	1.9952623149688797
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and <unk> she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment at her being so thin and so small	2.321954250288982
there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies	1.947868855775784
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were <unk> and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a <unk> in the proper direction before her eyes	1.8529220216409523
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer	2.192345972483447
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of <unk> which mr collins had promised and as he had likewise <unk> he took his seat at the <unk> of the table by her ladyship's desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater	1.8957356524063758
he <unk> and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to <unk> whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear	2.154434690031884
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them	2.4404928208331524
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time	2.232735148777284
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed	2.493704612424349
maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	2.8135838643513225
when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in <unk> her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment <unk>	1.9187520990478337
she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be <unk> in so small a family as her's and <unk> her as to the care of her <unk> and her poultry	1.9187520990478337
she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mother's <unk> name	1.9952623149688797
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly	2.225709236731149
lady catherine then observed "your father's estate is entailed on mr collins i think	2.0772192642920606
for your sake " turning to charlotte "i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for <unk> estates from the female line	2.624905609990315
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family	2.7521355349492356
do you play and sing miss bennet	1.5836381386501617
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you	2.589270007158454
"why did not you all learn	2.2720256971379897
you ought all to have learned	1.7765812220316897
the miss <unk> all play and their father has not so good an income as your's	2.3722268664694046
"no not at all	1.079457310283929
"what none of you	1.3869773627246498
but i suppose you had no opportunity	2.2814128129950264
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters	2.2867187317404802
"my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london	2.3161505118583365
"has your governess left you	1.3688579667138667
"we never had any governess	1.8238507743314927
five daughters brought up at home without a governess	1.896454047295347
i never heard of such a thing	2.3409095014709203
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education	2.3775671738792856
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case	2.9247110834953136
who attended to you	1.3757729662035194
without a governess you must have been neglected	2.6892452644227713
we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary	2.4783946416892486
those who chose to be idle certainly might	1.9835440824493737
"aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one	3.094535277935397
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it	2.3939559969067763
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of <unk> in that way	3.002555682262218
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out	2.3275423269425093
four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her	2.3713737056616555
mrs collins did i tell you of lady <unk> calling yesterday to thank me	2.269394888395423
she <unk> miss <unk> a treasure	1.873612719962112
<unk> catherine ' said she <unk> have given me a treasure	2.617972809675252
are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet	1.9967230456926146
what all five out at once	1.5025431088416203
and you only the second	1.5714035943079985
the younger ones out before the elder are married	2.0594789119091836
your younger sisters must be very young	2.2876089363352308
"yes my youngest is not sixteen	1.7261743956213258
but really ma'am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early	2.543345761304649
the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive	2.921625240119068
i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind	2.6004803411841353
pray what is your age	2.359488331654588
"with three younger sisters grown up " replied elizabeth smiling "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it	2.5574698118607633
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	2.885238730097245
"you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age	2.845097352641925
"i am not one and twenty	2.4657687674812316
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed	2.1552742052112603
their table was <unk> stupid	1.5389830805558986
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light	2.434291857956279
a great deal more passed at the other table	2.356771035290475
sir william did not say much	1.758896588894354
he was <unk> his memory with <unk> and noble names	2.82244359294139
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow	2.4862929968185914
as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlotte's sake she made more favourable than it really was	2.3713737056616555
sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled and of her <unk> such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with	2.321954250288982
while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <unk> and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road	1.4440241885954521
the room in which the ladies sat was <unk>	2.5577916653160577
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better <unk> room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement	1.6265507027536246
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day	1.9429496147158305
she not <unk> stopped at the parsonage and had a few <unk> conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	2.945963583072259
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <unk> to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours	1.9187520990478337
now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits	3.008820100134427
this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors	2.1187853261287715
her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity	1.8957356524063758
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	2.245635946056479
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important	2.823178236209787
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself	1.353876180022544
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence	1.9429496147158305
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects	1.9382443258705815
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	2.192345972483447
charlotte had seen them from her husband's room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding "i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility	2.477728953055774
mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me	2.2174435317616235
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	2.5431357891321253
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure	2.4244620170823286
elizabeth merely <unk> to him without saying a word	1.8050281346946278
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to any body	2.1187853261287715
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family	2.6780784573201992
she answered him in the usual way and after a moment's pause added "my eldest sister has been in town these three months	3.1144714049086386
have you never happened to see her there	2.44557432696509
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet	1.968419447286612
the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away	2.600498531981112
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings	2.7886642603722893
it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening	1.7615770326037883
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter	2.571944878874398
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had only seen at church	2.844166289701099
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing room	2.373649675180299
her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room	1.968419447286612
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	2.569088235134808
he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they <unk> with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy	1.7455628235338618
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out "what is that you are saying fitzwilliam	2.192345972483447
what is it you are talking of	2.149972134517089
what are you telling miss bennet	1.8614305861261589
let me hear what it is	1.7988836399925043
"we are speaking of music madam " said he when no longer able to avoid a reply	2.2635945284133867
then pray speak aloud	1.227724480726183
it is of all subjects my delight	2.049220214283924
i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music	2.4136996173242022
if i had ever learnt i should have been a great <unk>	3.560763246021557
and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply	2.141941573974427
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully	2.56970597710015
how does georgiana get on darcy	1.5554911643753748
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's <unk>	2.134125384219042
"i am very glad to hear such a good account of her " said lady catherine "and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not <unk> a great deal	2.610157215682537
she practises very constantly	1.2293148887434393
"so much the better	1.1582072768606915
it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account	2.9941575428270086
i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice	2.860473788084163
i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs <unk> room	1.968419447286612
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding and made no answer	2.1634182788510645
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument	2.6908026347065404
he drew a chair near her	1.5177601395129248
lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair <unk> countenance	2.085205857248754
elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an <unk> smile and said "you mean to <unk> me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me	2.543345761304649
but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well	2.609920170496897
there is a <unk> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others	2.9293057621928944
my courage always <unk> with every attempt to <unk> me	2.115857567919107
"i shall not say that you are mistaken " he replied "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <unk> opinions which in fact are not your own	1.8957356524063758
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say	2.761699813343848
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit	2.610157215682537
indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very <unk> too for it is provoking me to <unk> and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear	2.023589647725157
"i should like to know how he behaves among strangers	2.5088115132173114
"you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful	1.9618940301714045
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did	3.1126752494352954
i am sorry to pain you but so it was	2.31695106307801
he danced only four dances though gentlemen were <unk> and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner	2.7301434029070797
mr darcy you cannot deny the fact	1.9762318024259826
"i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party	3.0349018858498766
well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next	2.1212983936225096
my fingers wait your orders	1.3802240930599194
"perhaps " said darcy "i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	2.6927936322499417
"shall we ask your cousin the reason of this	1.7744777958138216
said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam	1.3906629346045074
"shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers	2.9198628894337904
"i can answer your question " said fitzwilliam <unk> applying to him	1.9126602538929516
it is because he will not give himself the trouble	2.3568731417439213
"i certainly have not the talent which some people possess " said darcy "of conversing easily with those i have never seen before	2.7278386753192163
i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done	2.228843821482425
"my fingers " said elizabeth "do not move over this instrument in the <unk> manner which i see so many <unk> do	3.1751505991593727
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of <unk>	3.2532827715766537
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution	3.07018956384848
darcy smiled and said "you are perfectly right	2.130270892600768
you have employed your time much better	1.7208708985160335
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting	2.225024415099027
we neither of us perform to strangers	1.7856289209389118
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of	2.586065542694258
elizabeth immediately began playing again	1.4399294804245983
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy "miss bennet would not play at all <unk> if she <unk> more and could have the advantage of a london master	2.761699813343848
she has a very good notion of <unk> though her taste is not equal to <unk>	2.704877812377526
anne would have been a delightful <unk> had her health allowed her to learn	2.8325822544836217
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance <unk> with them many instructions on execution and taste	2.1999305790142376
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home	3.046989570903508
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor	2.3713737056616555
as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the room	1.9429496147158305
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within	2.744728618273492
it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this <unk> recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed "how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy	1.968419447286612
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before	3.162277660168379
he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london	2.7890696761073817
<unk> so i thank you	1.3079950096365622
she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added "i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again	2.761699813343848
"i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future	3.007831305905438
he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing	2.597916367906777
but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle	2.6826957952797255
"i should not be surprised " said darcy "if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers	3.356035520004894
elizabeth made no answer	1.05344629380765
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him	2.871607693737397
lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford	2.7203854660151694
"i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object	3.045576109214938
"mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	1.9415127220621125
she seems perfectly happy however and in a <unk> light it is certainly a very good match for her	2.962674219692809
"it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends	3.4044570395129465
"an easy distance do you call it	1.8608625918506168
it is nearly fifty miles	1.3154597107106671
"and what is fifty miles of good road	2.0693739005024643
little more than half a day's journey	1.917186653467257
yes i call it a very easy distance	2.0670864751049307
"i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match " cried elizabeth	2.4313461676314856
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far	2.202242010729881
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered "i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family	2.023589647725157
the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances	2.1770866138451606
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling <unk> distance becomes no evil	2.4964226433737977
but that is not the case here	3.087014052997556
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent <unk> and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance	2.4244620170823286
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said " you cannot have a right to such very strong <unk> attachment	2.7678192221313176
you cannot have been always at longbourn	2.023416813760461
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a <unk> from the table and glancing over it said in a <unk> voice "are you pleased with kent	2.7250232977467665
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and <unk> and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk	2.6826957952797255
the tête à tête surprised them	1.5457877452787026
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away	2.7233243654908734
"what can be the meaning of this	1.7269000480654204
said charlotte as soon as he was gone	2.635614444836866
"my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way	3.115967498227673
but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte's wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year	1.8957356524063758
all field <unk> were over	1.5325725368570018
within doors there was lady catherine books and a <unk> table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the <unk> of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	1.8529220216409523
they called at various times of the morning sometimes <unk> sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt	2.6532743192128443
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating <unk> in colonel fitzwilliam's manners she believed he might have the best informed mind	1.5570684047537309
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand	2.4296286262691313
he seldom appeared really animated	1.3873232219202818
mrs collins knew not what to make of him	1.9650483612434666
colonel fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out	1.8329807108324359
she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success	2.8568278902637867
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was <unk>	2.9998404855135257
it was an earnest <unk> <unk> but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind	2.7910008594447087
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam	1.9818240283664783
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to <unk> these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all	2.3713737056616555
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy	2.332544924155729
she felt all the perverseness of the <unk> that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite <unk> of hers	2.3713737056616555
how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd	2.2879857254917186
it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary <unk> for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her	2.2758459260747883
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third <unk> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collins's happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too	1.474142020110622
his words seemed to <unk> it	1.6587218531026846
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts	1.8832619502948091
she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter	2.463955668169144
it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage	2.909282929436061
she was engaged one day as she walked in re <unk> jane's last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her	2.053525026457146
"i have been making the tour of the park " he replied "as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage	2.803847234933915
are you going much farther	1.389472560433733
"no i should have turned in a moment	2.497332527238028
"do you certainly leave kent on saturday	1.6970202050371364
"yes if darcy does not put it off again	1.9435640628960478
but i am at his disposal	2.6640201276952595
he <unk> the business just as he pleases	2.555029622426083
"and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice	2.756168644088805
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy	3.007092887707621
"he likes to have his own way very well " replied colonel fitzwilliam	2.3119666010153925
"but so we all do	1.634667123451561
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor	2.70240261954127
a younger son you know must be <unk> to self denial and dependence	2.411486444206669
"in my opinion the younger son of an <unk> can know very little of either	2.494864688116133
now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence	1.9046703708483899
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	2.3955351249574375
"these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many <unk> of that nature	2.8882387507243177
but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money	2.125516710172191
<unk> where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do	2.3861223257862756
<unk> habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money	2.553975199862107
"is this " thought elizabeth <unk> for me	2.299938207005502
and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone "and pray what is the usual price of an <unk> younger son	2.6527313524599165
unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	2.581151933818382
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped	3.017865984550551
i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind	2.250309471105975
but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her	2.897959685177002
"no " said colonel fitzwilliam "that is an advantage which he must divide with me	2.6237310488175316
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy	2.430847673689288
and pray what sort of <unk> do you make	2.423948270786301
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth	2.232735148777284
she directly replied "you need not be frightened	1.9551273058760497
i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most <unk> creatures in the world	3.221775349077111
i think i have heard you say that you know them	2.1309216025361275
"i know them a little	1.6062006985997732
their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy's	3.099179334060336
yes " said elizabeth drily "mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a <unk> deal of care of him	3.1166466476364234
yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care	2.60684026874096
from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him	2.554553349273312
but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant	3.332324102317723
it was all conjecture	2.0620912942257923
"it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady's family it would be an unpleasant thing	2.942727176209282
"you may depend upon my not mentioning it	1.6132893685966345
"and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley	3.4094534444962927
"did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference	1.984138492534245
"and what arts did he use to separate them	1.887831167749436
"he did not talk to me of his own arts " said fitzwilliam smiling	2.8623865070784005
"he only told me what i have now told you	2.1832250851304638
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart <unk> with indignation	2.485389641692012
after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so <unk>	2.273259311644722
"your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings	1.650570873266915
why was he to be the judge	2.7645585914571216
"you are rather disposed to call his interference officious	1.8628932736963302
"i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy	2.3713737056616555
"but " she continued recollecting herself "as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him	2.8463319211055493
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case	2.929224512050302
"that is not an unnatural surmise " said fitzwilliam "but it is <unk> the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly	3.263347253745112
this was spoken <unk> but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage	2.3713737056616555
there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard	3.2219118023700273
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected	2.6081670179357888
there could not <unk> in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have such <unk> influence	3.4179699423496115
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	2.761699813343848
if his own vanity however did not <unk> him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer	3.046989570903508
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have <unk>	2.7203821354975166
"there were some very strong objections against the lady " were colonel fitzwilliam's words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london	2.4625734095116076
"to jane herself " she exclaimed "there could be no possibility of objection	2.1697127242463496
all loveliness and goodness as she is	1.7284904978531859
neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some <unk> has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach	2.668617873781687
when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister	1.5085907086001784
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a <unk> and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea	2.085205857248754
mrs collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home	2.192345972483447
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent	2.4244620170823286
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to <unk> her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever <unk>	2.023589647725157
elizabeth noticed every sentence <unk> the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal	2.829946821793494
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	1.9187520990478337
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little <unk> by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her	2.023589647725157
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the room	2.5177026510638347
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health <unk> his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better	2.554483173267436
she answered him with cold civility	1.7351611324506062
elizabeth was surprised but said not a word	1.6272144910387427
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began "in vain have i struggled	2.4057736894310295
it will not do	1.437579320248281
my feelings will not be repressed	1.9444953093569028
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression	1.819712401480987
she stared coloured doubted and was silent	1.7385111995385936
this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed	2.809493204400151
his sense of her inferiority of its being a <unk> of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit	2.192345972483447
she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done	2.5098350491386268
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security	2.245503729427293
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said "in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however <unk> they may be returned	2.053525026457146
it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you	2.5004207498450124
but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly	2.958354958863644
it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration	2.957296584483167
the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in <unk> it after this explanation	2.706841837354535
his complexion became pale with anger and the <unk> of his mind was visible in every feature	2.7876824451585263
he was <unk> for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have <unk> it	3.1128827965345027
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful	1.8735621902184245
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said "and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting	3.143689123165204
i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected	2.4547768807970503
but it is of small importance	2.639537325959618
"i might as well enquire " replied she "why with so evident a design of offending and <unk> me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character	2.4244620170823286
was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil	2.267456574220104
but i have other <unk>	2.191535581888926
you know i have	1.6647888938559166
had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of <unk> perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister	2.053525026457146
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued	2.3291367932341247
"i have every reason in the world to think ill of you	2.6974139672507036
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there	1.8411426135720388
you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of <unk> them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and <unk> the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the <unk> kind	1.8957356524063758
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly <unk> by any feeling of <unk>	2.8946379872244647
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	2.4242099449987005
"can you deny that you have done it	2.142548795473167
elizabeth disdained the appearance of <unk> this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to <unk> her	2.552487098571842
long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided	2.5254405097440014
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham	2.3448909653745185
on this subject what can you have to say	2.6437736318646152
or under what <unk> can you here impose upon others	2.0781964487494387
"who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him	2.092780450928328
repeated darcy <unk> "yes his misfortunes have been great indeed	1.8855298007739125
"you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty	1.9912571093916693
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his <unk>	2.56112437324381
but perhaps " added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her "these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my <unk> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design	2.321954250288982
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater <unk> concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being <unk> by <unk> <unk> inclination by reason by reflection by every thing	2.610157215682537
they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections	2.3627488881826237
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own	2.413622395931739
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said "you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner	1.701254279852589
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued "you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it	2.610157215682537
again his astonishment was <unk> and he looked at her with an expression of <unk> incredulity and mortification	2.8852959874348194
"from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners <unk> me with the <unk> belief of your <unk> your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry	1.4806572771858608
"you have said quite enough madam	1.686381079699435
i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	2.3928574313246673
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness	2.4393228955522313
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great	2.4401631166002407
her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it	2.0888771531396406
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy	2.1867290797351613
that he should have been in love with her for so many months	3.4568296093899633
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible	2.2758459260747883
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	2.1338878216163795
but his pride his abominable pride his <unk> avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in <unk> though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	1.701254279852589
she continued in very <unk> reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation and hurried her away to her room	2.8167177997744184
elizabeth <unk> the next morning to the same thoughts and <unk> which had at length closed her eyes	3.0183762617779046
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	2.4816289228368253
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the <unk> road	2.4816289228368253
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground	2.7265185460844896
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and <unk> forward with eagerness pronounced her name	2.9010031352248125
she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate	3.056209823082813
he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure "i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you	2.4244620170823286
will you do me the honour of reading that letter	2.55624743238006
with no expectation of pleasure but with the <unk> curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two <unk> of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand	2.543345761304649
the envelope itself was likewise full	1.4910227428759601
pursuing her way along the lane she then began it	2.046529802714934
it was dated from rosings at eight o'clock in the morning and was as follows <unk> not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so <unk> to you	2.085205857248754
i write without any intention of <unk> you or <unk> myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the <unk> and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read	1.8738174228603839
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice	2.4148815188066783
<unk> offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal <unk> you last night laid to my charge	2.608337910113202
the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and <unk> the prospects of mr wickham	2.085205857248754
wilfully and <unk> to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a <unk> to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the <unk> of only a few weeks could bear no comparison	1.6618362775387496
if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's i can only say that i am sorry	2.7921881779204805
the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd	1.880068017475057
i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country	3.0214544249675277
i had often seen him in love before	2.1678269783891135
at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas's accidental information that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage	2.4244620170823286
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be <unk>	2.8704592788660057
from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him	2.7163440911561176
your sister i also watched	1.6933799054906162
her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening's <unk> that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any <unk> of sentiment	2.192345972483447
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable	2.3527648497815314
if it be so if i have been <unk> by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable	3.123263647503061
but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched	2.2758459260747883
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my <unk> and <unk> are not usually <unk> by my hopes or fears	3.162277660168379
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason	2.9023626627726817
my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me	2.1187853261287715
but there were other causes of <unk> causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me	2.4403444339780123
these causes must be stated though briefly	1.6288059756367426
the situation of your mother's family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father	2.397529714670155
it pains me to offend you	2.016147622652993
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both	1.715437896342879
he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning	2.6389093645563917
the part which i acted is now to be explained	2.2293440053831626
his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our <unk> of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in <unk> their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london	2.3713737056616555
we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice	2.6278834699499485
i described and <unk> them earnestly	2.1057158672622664
but however this <unk> might have <unk> or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would <unk> have prevented the marriage had it not been <unk> by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister's indifference	2.321954250288982
but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own	2.271142712140474
to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point	2.7919591557674366
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town	2.232735148777284
i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it	2.919946287126615
that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough <unk> for him to see her without some danger	2.910091177463977
perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me	1.5969836246180302
it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer	3.1599575059910676
if i have wounded your sister's feelings it was <unk> done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them	2.848035868435802
with respect to that other more <unk> <unk> of having injured mr wickham i can only <unk> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family	3.162277660168379
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can <unk> more than one witness of <unk> veracity	3.290344562312668
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed	1.8329807108324359
my father supported him at school and afterwards at <unk> most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education	2.6826957952797255
my father was not only fond of this young man's society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it	2.4244620170823286
as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner	3.35561680828061
the <unk> <unk> the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have	1.9429496147158305
here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell	2.4066793259422226
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <unk> his real character	2.537183926973305
it adds even another motive	1.3816777167460559
my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his <unk> in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant	1.701254279852589
there was also a <unk> of one thousand pounds	2.274949661715771
he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <unk>	2.6850500637476404
i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to <unk> to his proposal	2.9905912132798673
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman	3.620532130444496
the business was therefore soon settled	1.6237577258424953
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds	2.772339020479008
all connection between us seemed now <unk>	1.7089696660547702
i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town	2.448671390908661
in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and <unk>	2.6320653137533476
his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad	2.6154395497511813
he had found the law a most <unk> study and was now absolutely resolved on being <unk> if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my <unk> father's intentions	1.7782794100389228
after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt	1.9357922498374522
how he lived i know not	1.5716498308784348
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	2.0643586521802026
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <unk> to any human being	2.8898214898689645
having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy	2.3730116647869512
my sister who is more than ten years my <unk> was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself	2.5471070072542803
about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who <unk> over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her <unk> and <unk> he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement	1.3894954943731377
she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself	2.7380505058165014
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted	2.4613247597459242
regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public <unk> but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge	2.854959884666852
mr wickham's chief object was <unk> my sister's fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of <unk> himself on me was a strong inducement	2.8199294530888444
his revenge would have been complete indeed	2.481599304924114
this madam is a faithful <unk> of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me <unk> of cruelty towards mr wickham	2.4816289228368253
i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at	2.729099611570237
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night	2.10426971521646
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed	2.598010550666307
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents	2.694658340915888
but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a <unk> of emotion they excited	3.190518927681267
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal	2.4816289228368253
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield	2.624825388094025
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of <unk> and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes	2.610157215682537
his belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice	2.610157215682537
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not <unk> but haughty	2.8071882368750147
it was all pride and <unk>	2.1723021295144487
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when she read with somewhat <unk> attention a relation of events which if true must <unk> every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of <unk>	1.79571449437164
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her	1.7548888197418715
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming "this must be false	2.1434796798485967
this must be the <unk> falsehood	2.5279100460532087
and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again	2.4244620170823286
in this <unk> state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	1.7301957388458942
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words	2.4244620170823286
but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham's <unk> all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate	2.2758459260747883
she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be <unk> <unk> on the probability of each statement but with little success	3.3080576597651814
on both sides it was only assertion	2.170160543492326
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr darcy's conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <unk> throughout the whole	2.1187853261287715
the extravagance and general <unk> which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham's charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice	2.6467465647602193
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance	2.4816289228368253
of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself	2.5181983985252927
as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring	3.1651386843203517
but no such recollection <unk> her	1.793437339368364
after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read	2.3614592273195947
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was <unk> for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs and whose character she had no reason to question	1.6618362775387496
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have <unk> such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin's <unk>	1.968419447286612
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	2.092998874619719
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct	2.690395862070264
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had <unk> the netherfield ball the very next week	2.4244620170823286
she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr darcy's character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son	1.7301957388458942
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned	2.660447756948878
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling	2.2758459260747883
that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible	2.192345972483447
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself	1.4763910058521292
"how <unk> have i acted	1.6521803588085506
"i who have <unk> myself on my discernment	2.2669716096354495
i who have valued myself on my abilities	2.0209144378170034
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or <unk> distrust how humiliating is this discovery	2.319267122889569
yet how just a humiliation	1.4510524315972777
had i been in love i could not have been more <unk> blind	3.148438352221599
but vanity not love has been my folly	1.9832703048230482
pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned	2.632857254893317
till this moment i never knew myself	1.9032457641014444
from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy's explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again	2.761699813343848
widely different was the effect of a second perusal	2.1850121054641116
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other	2.79892658409446
he declared himself to have been totally <unk> of her sister's attachment and she could not help remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been	3.1473616089313716
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane	2.081329972579458
she felt that jane's feelings though <unk> were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility	2.8141383803947475
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe	2.954984478276518
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers	2.1187853261287715
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt	3.1359253324655025
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining <unk> and <unk> herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of <unk> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	1.566048452832833
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found	1.8738174228603839
elizabeth could but just affect concern in <unk> him she really rejoiced at it	2.2975792004289897
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object	2.2994588218861334
she could think only of her letter	2.2425653457516677
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting <unk> was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings	1.8139306939110624
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship <unk> that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her	2.085205857248754
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyship's indignation would have been	2.2758459260747883
"what would she have said	1.511207536181692
how would she have behaved	1.5185981713841146
were questions with which she amused herself	1.903678630499415
their first subject was the <unk> of the rosings party	2.765612414010766
but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me	3.0422856488903296
they were excessively sorry to go	1.5447837505757835
but so they always are	1.5577622616077353
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year	2.4858848938191196
his attachment to rosings certainly <unk>	2.12811221044915
mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	2.6438684762976012
"i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation " replied elizabeth "but it is not in my power to accept it	2.7414251243464434
i must be in town next saturday	2.807723165547372
i expected you to stay two months	1.8339626495690606
there can be no occasion for your going so soon	2.0941205213295087
mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight	2.212770863767548
"but my father cannot	1.39182589600559
your father of course may spare you if your mother can	2.080550025049196
and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as <unk> does not object to the <unk> <unk> there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large	1.5483652565854986
"you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan	2.3056369814324205
lady catherine seemed resigned	1.728364582260928
"mrs collins you must send a servant with them	2.1153196245911228
you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves	3.0056915172427088
it is highly improper	1.2246748104403684
you must contrive to send somebody	1.5820588116471914
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing	2.862482311613451
young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life	1.9441244301651375
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her	2.4012090344040464
i am excessively attentive to all those things	1.8899986556774409
you must send <unk> with the young ladies mrs collins	2.9369104581998586
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be <unk> to you to let them go alone	3.5048638801111274
"my uncle is to send a servant for us	2.18843447594917
he keeps a man servant does he	1.7078702717139715
i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things	2.0974864665939497
where shall you change horses	1.3873481899421947
if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to	2.356526472288103
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was	2.192345972483447
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections	2.2758459260747883
mr darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart	2.8791246888032416
she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different	2.2264173007540453
when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and <unk> him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion	2.321954250288982
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment <unk> her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	2.768997222131711
in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet <unk> <unk>	2.958962909503611
they were hopeless of remedy	1.3752929912834961
her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild <unk> of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil	2.610157215682537
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence what chance could there be of improvement	2.595015517681737
catherine weak <unk> irritable and completely under lydia's guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia self <unk> and careless would scarcely give them a hearing	2.363898211667841
they were ignorant idle and vain	1.543547313076487
while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever	2.8724272687349
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so <unk> with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and <unk> of her own family	2.610157215682537
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	2.232735148777284
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of <unk> and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her <unk> <unk>	1.5013107289081733
when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both	2.321954250288982
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <unk> <unk> necessary	2.942727176209282
"i know not miss elizabeth " said he "whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it	2.3713737056616555
the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you	2.001159847198001
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode	2.341724938094815
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged	2.7597366555788585
mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied "it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not <unk>	3.1651585096111967
we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome	1.968419447286612
our situation with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are	2.5050454418606276
you see how continually we are engaged there	2.0158269525071444
in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one <unk> in it an object of compassion while they are <unk> of our intimacy at rosings	2.610157215682537
"you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin	2.38520414250021
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so	3.75677639127288
only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage	2.8087328704133823
we seem to have been designed for each other	2.0994213428269397
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she <unk> believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	2.771414972676979
she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they <unk>	2.9314276356104987
it was melancholy to leave her to such society	2.240053499563939
but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion	3.332451223213491
her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their <unk> concerns had not yet lost their charms	2.7601089151381797
after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was <unk> her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner though unknown	1.7782794100389228
he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some <unk> that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings	2.4244620170823286
"but " he added "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here	2.842296715516499
elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off	3.119576290213664
and yet how many things have happened	1.803819419988416
"a great many indeed " said her companion with a sigh	2.7169848563410297
"we have dined nine times at rosings besides <unk> tea there twice	1.886721717845556
elizabeth privately added "and how much i shall have to conceal	2.5228465841816763
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiner's house where they were to remain a few days	2.684393330807028
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them	2.494987656513621
but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	3.0299841407975765
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcy's proposals	3.5231091293213734
to know that she had the power of <unk> what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <unk> but the state of <unk> in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther	1.4556047973707602
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the <unk> inn where mr bennet's carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in <unk> of the <unk> punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs	1.7455628235338618
after <unk> their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <unk> usually <unk> exclaiming "is not this nice	2.2821050421303246
is not this an agreeable surprise	1.6702304259248704
"and we mean to treat you all " added lydia "but you must <unk> us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there	2.5822311170983383
then shewing her purchases <unk> here i have bought this bonnet	2.0520751457259503
i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not	3.4901678645240666
i shall <unk> it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better	3.179806066056274
but there were two or three much <unk> in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to <unk> it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable	2.942727176209282
besides it will not much signify what one <unk> this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight	2.796625770684222
cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction	1.8364899496453548
"they are going to be <unk> near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer	3.0287477723090963
it would be such a <unk> scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all	3.3610777835184806
mamma would like to go too of all things	2.1057020427894226
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have	2.0517242907901854
"yes " thought elizabeth " that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once	2.8419998809552305
brighton and a whole <unk> of <unk> to us who have been <unk> already by one poor regiment of militia and the <unk> balls of meryton	3.0983358759733504
"now i have got some news for you " said lydia as they sat down to table	2.419230969402443
"what do you think	1.621826088465574
it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like	2.191901733579886
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay	3.344918561546553
lydia laughed and said "aye that is just like your formality and discretion	2.1417446101938835
i dare say he often <unk> worse things said than i am going to say	2.6214033971514494
but he is an ugly fellow	2.533426181663509
i am glad he is gone	1.8776048567649029
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king	2.419826181363533
"and mary king is safe	1.4363422901990075
added elizabeth <unk> from a connection imprudent as to fortune	2.4475266876963673
"she is a great fool for going away if she liked him	2.3587655035844985
"but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side " said jane	2.3459694355158494
"i am sure there is not on his	2.9794601730928485
who could about such a <unk> little <unk> thing	2.5009721630820243
elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly <unk> and fancied liberal	2.4540489544486856
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their <unk> <unk> and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases were seated in it	2.2758459260747883
"how <unk> we are <unk> in	1.8360035921178188
"i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another <unk>	2.730919843703768
well now let us be quite comfortable and <unk> and talk and laugh all the way home	2.560673215561061
and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away	2.680179212728296
have you seen any pleasant men	1.5611828376542862
have you had any flirting	1.702621338910093
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back	3.2596382596411266
jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare	2.1405425351468708
she is almost three and twenty	1.435254038149437
lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty	2.4980227116888027
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can't think	2.2992318460358825
how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would <unk> you about to all the balls	3.6294300821565373
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel <unk>	2.50360027076479
we dressed up <unk> in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun	2.422094584659303
not a soul knew of it but <unk>	2.0518451475217443
and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked	2.8722261321498985
when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord	3.7559297580349704
and so did mrs forster	1.3794637692554275
i thought i should have died	2.1288588585198607
and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter	2.652314585507762
their reception at home was most kind	1.9714094263834703
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in <unk> beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth "i am glad you are come back lizzy	2.5723885781384017
their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was <unk> engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other <unk> them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather <unk> than any other person's was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	1.3768571648527583
mary " said she "i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun	3.017176990141246
as we went along kitty and me drew up all the <unk> and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the <unk> cold <unk> in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too	1.5848931924611136
and then when we came away it was such fun	2.368093573557102
i thought we never should have got into the coach	2.0675644850461663
i was ready to die of laughter	1.8169797779282963
and then we were so merry all the way home	2.0980654245031363
we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off	2.298634141451392
to this mary very gravely replied <unk> be it from me my dear sister to <unk> such pleasures	2.6441794732301642
they would doubtless be <unk> with the generality of female minds	2.693784971589036
i should infinitely prefer a book	1.4664427217036033
but of this answer lydia heard not a word	2.0649388551982955
it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	3.6274288557465413
she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	2.479302814721674
the comfort to her of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression	2.303269870088599
in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account	2.8808271721802803
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents	2.848035868435802
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his <unk> were at the same time so vague and <unk> that her mother though often <unk> had never yet despaired of succeeding at last chapter xvii	2.321954250288982
miss bennet's astonishment was soon <unk> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	2.6546838986299885
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him	2.543345761304649
"his being so sure of succeeding was wrong " said she "and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment	2.5602998283773166
"indeed " replied elizabeth "i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me	2.978374553556612
you do not blame me however for refusing him	2.62584429159075
"but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham	2.098639756668299
"no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did	2.8276562445542526
"but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day	2.627861252931429
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham	2.912137791373321
what a stroke was this for poor jane	2.1768166794419064
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole <unk> of <unk> as was here collected in one individual	2.749531378442163
nor was darcy's vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery	2.3951619886025846
most earnestly did she <unk> to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other	2.4622876915567335
"this will not do " said elizabeth	2.0371780042544034
"you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing	2.461705630703882
there is but such a <unk> of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been <unk> about pretty much	3.1723057028220936
for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy's but you shall do as you chuse	2.644269949365452
"i do not know when i have been more shocked " said she	3.269342616725541
"wickham so very bad	1.3947901930340585
it is almost past belief	1.4433379446903678
and poor mr darcy	1.1319192098729558
dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered	2.0348308476368437
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too	2.412187752258551
it is really too distressing	1.4445550084097414
no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both	2.313312788406336
i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	2.631021512481783
your <unk> makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a <unk>	2.5373477859474463
<unk> wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance	2.4579588381183304
such an openness and gentleness in his manner	1.7160826869019867
"there certainly was some great <unk> in the education of those two young men	2.817115896294524
"i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do	2.469871063940602
it is such a <unk> to one's genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	3.093550173097676
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <unk> on something <unk>	2.683928041133198
"lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now	2.857653554485373
i was uncomfortable enough	1.1584938427965408
and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had	2.6826957952797255
how i wanted you	1.2231366570564504
"how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly <unk>	2.7814760440327233
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging	2.6555043039988977
there is one point on which i want your advice	2.40759595028838
i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character	2.9938358135008802
miss bennet paused a little and then replied <unk> there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully	2.4257624456478086
what is your own opinion	1.992074123078815
mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public	2.823361821592264
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to <unk> people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me	2.4816289228368253
the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light	3.0125040783654367
wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is	2.54779232317845
<unk> <unk> it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before	2.837197782307836
at present i will say nothing about it	1.779469591607295
"you are quite right	1.5498022651957444
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character	2.6614583936797116
we must not make him desperate	2.575015552884154
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was <unk> by this conversation	2.8370572429894976
she had got rid of two of the <unk> which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either	2.6826957952797255
but there was still something <unk> behind of which prudence <unk> the <unk>	2.464402204143267
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy's letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend	3.21619354818545
here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <unk> of <unk>	2.761699813343848
"and then " said she "if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself	2.8398323327019845
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value	2.304149103537567
she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits	2.980077018849776
jane was not happy	1.6750897400075222
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley	1.8880514319846315
"well lizzy " said mrs bennet one day "what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane's	2.7990865733342343
for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody	2.529562806275367
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london	2.7762794522884633
well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now	3.3117070357794836
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know	3.1693256697457732
"i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	2.9969993334785907
it is just as he <unk>	1.952783134643155
nobody wants him to come	1.5949595448531821
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it	3.083640050426779
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer	2.3955740834877526
"well lizzy " continued her mother soon afterwards "and so the collinses live very comfortable do they	2.3138095772144913
well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep	2.4976742403827634
charlotte is an excellent <unk> i dare say	1.8056239166241927
if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough	2.341769697603722
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say	2.0892470755205736
"no nothing at all	1.0484002684446034
"a great deal of good management depend upon it	1.7898168937494243
they will take care not to <unk> their income	2.3977580728686343
they will never be distressed for money	1.9920276410067588
well much good may it do them	1.7601417717956473
and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead	2.0627633224035047
"it was a subject which they could not mention before me	2.8870329255795673
it would have been strange if they had	2.5012237863127043
but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves	2.118458827234891
well if they can be easy with an estate that is not <unk> their own so much the better	2.8899412043274424
the first week of their return was soon gone	2.02014674137619
it was the last of the regiment's stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were <unk> <unk>	3.27616081530489
the dejection was almost universal	1.510528503209197
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments	2.1985441827832406
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard <unk> in any of the family	2.516244848526708
what is to become of us	1.270170748824479
what are we to do	1.3861116308903052
"how can you be smiling so lizzy	1.8887928437732684
"i am sure " said she "i cried for two days together when colonel <unk> regiment went away	2.6003045742210498
i thought i should have broke my heart	2.1220255781444446
"i am sure i shall break mine " said lydia	2.468241958133662
"if one could but go to brighton	1.283397624053432
if one could but go to brighton	1.283397624053432
but papa is so disagreeable	1.5298655213132815
"a little <unk> bathing would set me up for ever	2.1054973732418536
"and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good " added kitty	2.2772350742202656
such were the kind of lamentations <unk> perpetually through longbourn house	2.2086165867270133
she felt <unk> the justice of mr darcy's objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend	2.663360425967738
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton	2.711837860455288
this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married	2.407273926857007
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three <unk> acquaintance they had been intimate two	2.9237291225300703
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her <unk> of mrs forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described	2.9443315242454844
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings lydia flew about the house in <unk> ecstacy calling for every one's congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the <unk> kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	2.023589647725157
"i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia " said she "though i am not her particular friend	3.368051086971666
i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older	2.866331875101002
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned	3.132256433355713
as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from <unk> in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death <unk> of all possibility of common sense for the latter and <unk> as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly <unk> her father not to let her go	1.715437896342879
she represented to him all the <unk> of lydia's general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home	1.968419447286612
he heard her attentively and then said "lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances	2.1187853261287715
"if you were aware " said elizabeth "of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair	2.154434690031884
"what has she frightened away some of your lovers	2.0049479542268225
but do not be cast down	2.407140899691181
such <unk> <unk> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <unk> are not worth a regret	2.828336440634137
come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly	2.24829678533175
"indeed you are mistaken	1.3741441892179114
i have no such <unk> to resent	2.644060996908545
it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now <unk>	2.8602942443708557
our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild <unk> the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia's character	2.6861011469439453
excuse me for i must speak plainly	2.2189178937863567
if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her <unk> spirits and of teaching her that her present <unk> are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment	2.321954250288982
her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous	2.813554492386801
a flirt too in the worst and <unk> degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and <unk> of her mind wholly unable to <unk> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite	2.085205857248754
in this danger kitty is also comprehended	1.7358474144897613
vain ignorant idle and absolutely <unk>	1.5257684699022955
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply "do not make yourself uneasy my love	2.569065419546708
wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters	2.848035868435802
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton	2.376016010319569
let her go then	1.6129067095001408
colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body	2.55441730698003
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here	2.7063074166950427
the officers will find women better worth their notice	1.8374482775410905
let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance	2.444898512536074
at any rate she cannot grow many <unk> worse without <unk> us to <unk> her up for the rest of her life	2.7661284148696588
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be <unk> but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry	3.152006990847419
it was not in her nature however to increase her <unk> by dwelling on them	2.581941427973192
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over <unk> evils or <unk> them by anxiety was no part of her disposition	2.537187752102068
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united <unk>	2.6422699414811834
in lydia's imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of <unk> happiness	2.163180920927799
she saw all the <unk> of the camp its <unk> <unk> forth in <unk> <unk> of lines crowded with the young and the gay and <unk> with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a <unk> tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	2.023589647725157
they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same	2.5982690741289813
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself	2.8148860667248643
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home	2.6134749717433166
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time	2.9425716944919817
having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the <unk> of former partiality entirely so	2.7182287644436243
she had even learnt to <unk> in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a <unk> to disgust and weary	3.1239396838823663
in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her	2.192345972483447
her answer was warmly in his favour	1.6859207107694167
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added "how long did you say that he was at rosings	3.016193229793583
"yes almost every day	1.134242474857782
"his manners are very different from his cousin's	2.2353972330487215
but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance	2.0627885247718485
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her	2.477037057514558
"and pray may i ask	1.2700051937680836
but checking himself he added in a <unk> tone "is it in address that he improves	2.691294677488576
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style	2.0838027863254887
for i dare not hope " he continued in a lower and more serious tone "that he is improved in essentials	2.5409902529012114
"in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was	2.4264302902458272
while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning	2.4206211003268314
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an <unk> and anxious attention while she added "when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood	1.8738174228603839
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the <unk> of accents "you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right	1.6744824380115346
his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must <unk> him from such <unk> misconduct as i have suffered by	2.946834579929898
i only fear that the sort of <unk> to which you i imagine have been <unk> is merely <unk> on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe	2.610157215682537
his fear of her has always <unk> i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <unk> the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart	2.2758459260747883
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him	2.690507953132907
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	2.3713737056616555
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning	2.672344900872314
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than <unk>	2.7383215348284993
kitty was the only one who <unk> tears but she did <unk> from vexation and envy	2.7794186464678226
mrs bennet was <unk> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and <unk> in her <unk> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the <unk> happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	1.6618362775387496
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort	2.842110065007792
respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown	2.340863871714937
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	2.4816289228368253
he was fond of the country and of books and from these <unk> had arisen his principal <unk>	2.4336246525036613
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had <unk> to his amusement	3.087623632559727
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true <unk> will derive benefit from such as are given	2.4816289228368253
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband	2.4952555202595152
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of <unk> the mind of his wife	1.7301957388458942
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment	2.3888206581214972
their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <unk> at the <unk> of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time <unk> her natural degree of sense since the <unk> of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be <unk> was likely to be <unk> in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a <unk> place and a camp	1.4556047973707602
upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself	2.543345761304649
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of <unk> console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment	2.085205857248754
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the <unk> of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	1.9952623149688797
"but it is fortunate " thought she "that i have something to wish for	2.7229288105621317
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain	1.9162745381554143
but here by carrying with me one <unk> source of regret in my sister's absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <unk>	2.4485985843672435
a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only <unk> off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation	2.6088121308466024
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short	2.5840560279550275
those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	1.3650078065460138
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn	2.4957787246014025
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose	2.7339755276898607
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and <unk> a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire	1.4677992676220695
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	3.3753746847362778
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock <unk> <unk> or the <unk>	2.232735148777284
but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again	3.215895828976038
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected	2.2326639949817038
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner	2.8869570737046644
"but surely " said she "i may enter his county with <unk> and rob it of a few <unk> <unk> without his perceiving me	2.9389193306691315
the period of expectation was now <unk>	1.9472145217924572
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival	2.476100272487229
but they did pass away and mr and mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn	2.3480225993555037
the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them	1.8329807108324359
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement	2.7902115494596167
one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to <unk> every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were <unk> abroad	2.4244620170823286
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> c	2.848035868435802
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern	2.302862839088797
to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiner's former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated	1.9187520990478337
it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it	2.7489624224992406
in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	2.557502878025781
mr gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation	2.4650274439545323
"my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much	2.9812739200483405
"a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected	2.4514504990786463
wickham passed all his youth there you know	1.8070571196297784
she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	2.956965141393939
she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine <unk> or satin <unk>	2.654684349886878
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity	1.5438468804497538
"if it were merely a fine house <unk> <unk> " said she "i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful	2.7392382308746828
it would be dreadful	2.985136281814632
she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk	2.5333093445118022
but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last <unk> if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were <unk> answered	3.046989570903508
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer	2.4816289228368253
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her <unk> being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme	1.701254279852589
to pemberley therefore they were to go	1.6908225230781295

elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter	2.7219557047701093
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground	1.9187364427284301
they entered it in one of its <unk> points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood <unk> over a wide extent	2.41682472143247
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view	2.4360394577369378
they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the <unk> of a considerable <unk> where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound	2.085205857248754
it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and <unk> by a <unk> of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was <unk> into greater but without any <unk> appearance	2.4244620170823286
its banks were neither formal nor <unk> adorned	1.7074202234856137
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste	2.6836098758358085
they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something	3.1500885069248765
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	2.819631058342858
on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was	2.7053722000506863
the housekeeper came a respectable looking <unk> woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her	2.4476019847609276
they followed her into the dining parlour	1.8119731681976123
it was a large well <unk> room handsomely fitted up	2.4186089083359494
elizabeth after slightly <unk> it went to a window to enjoy its prospect	2.2833731809371125
the hill <unk> with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object	2.3517154373708924
every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the <unk> of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight	2.543345761304649
as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different <unk> but from every window there were beauties to be seen	2.3045393875321745
the rooms were <unk> and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither <unk> nor <unk> fine with less of <unk> and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	2.154434690031884
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted	1.9988127023670599
but no " recollecting herself "that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them	3.157823134524314
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it	2.545331402450217
at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds replied that he was adding "but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends	2.610157215682537
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day	2.280062251452973
her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it	2.0004821361724834
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late master's steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence	2.848035868435802
"he is now gone into the army " she added "but i am afraid he has turned out very wild	2.6458428069126265
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it	2.7675194493045274
"and that " said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures "is my master and very like him	2.612772419525813
it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago	2.4816010936262978
but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not	2.3210610401339284
mrs <unk> respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this <unk> of her knowing her master	2.8308125116491074
"does that young lady know mr darcy	1.7181229807757041
elizabeth coloured and said "a little	1.7944736356672046
"and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma'am	2.941022311569829
"i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this	2.6427320501639597
this room was my late master's favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then	2.4284315917610173
he was very fond of them	1.988955105985367
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham's being among them	2.2209445877426193
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old	2.6091149388787938
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished	2.0954967051811284
she <unk> and <unk> all day long	3.2134341700210967
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him	2.600119534446061
mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her <unk> by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister	2.6826957952797255
"not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months	3.105448663012458
<unk> " thought elizabeth "when she goes to ramsgate	2.4134877853153656
"if your master would marry you might see more of him	2.1148253282566065
"yes sir but i do not know when that will be	2.429086459091478
mr and mrs gardiner smiled	2.287498091577942
"i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him " replied the other	2.7112215287698294
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added "i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old	2.321954250288982
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas	2.0703473762292903
that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion	3.2097738409068586
her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying "there are very few people of whom so much can be said	2.6744073419801877
"yes sir i know i am	1.8176479937943202
if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better	3.649025955306146
but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous <unk> boy in the world	2.761699813343848
elizabeth almost stared at her	1.3178151118241763
"his father was an excellent man " said mrs gardiner	2.1667855880736986
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more	1.8325486092459107
mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point	1.962152921447663
"he is the best landlord and the best master " said she "that ever lived	2.7478237013957285
not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves	2.3169437786049025
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name	3.1062341510696974
some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it	2.6286148514276313
to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men	2.7620511012721716
"in what an amiable light does this place him	1.9753163882542433
"this fine account of him " <unk> her aunt as they walked "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend	2.8330949554947513
"perhaps we might be deceived	1.4560701773578912
"that is not very likely our authority was too good	2.2872219755716627
"he is certainly a good brother " said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows	3.1754805266892316
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight when she should enter the room	2.0122896286159047
"whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment	2.545039429388851
in the former were many good <unk> but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some <unk> of miss darcy's in <unk> whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible	2.085205857248754
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger	2.7633257151391843
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her	2.3223734538818968
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery	2.3602181098101944
mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's life time	2.5598271117324987
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth's mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	2.588247395562861
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature	2.2846895588550287
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant	2.140334304225828
as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship	2.366219811857941
how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow	2.871635182747663
how much of good or evil must be done by him	2.2518166351046074
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the <unk> on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression	1.7782794100389228
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were <unk> over to the <unk> who met them at the hall door	2.543345761304649
their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush	2.588692078635129
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome	2.3400854857633897
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family	2.4816289228368253
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life	1.9429496147158305
nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual <unk> and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the <unk> of his thoughts	1.8738174228603839
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave	2.4794627117263572
she was overpowered by shame and vexation	1.4376318126600764
her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world	2.2046947037115174
how strange must it appear to him	1.6789489071177437
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again	2.5492044052936462
why did she come	1.3968589415494161
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected	2.576997112140229
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting	2.2481232247680523
and his behaviour so <unk> altered what could it mean	2.105196833284849
that he should even speak to her was amazing	3.048741308613571
but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family	2.337434102983275
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	2.485561657158259
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in <unk> park when he put his letter into her hand	2.477930312807841
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a <unk> fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered <unk> to the repeated <unk> of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene	1.5160826983319609
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was	2.628850108530125
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure	3.224963658101426
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	2.7264208482601333
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <unk> were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods <unk> many and occasionally part of the stream	1.8139306939110624
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round	2.650211903915225
it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed <unk> which brought them again after some time in a descent among <unk> woods to the edge of the water in one of its <unk> parts	2.6826957952797255
elizabeth longed to <unk> its <unk> but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	2.192345972483447
her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some <unk> in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little	1.5947870582948211
whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching them and at no great distance	2.543345761304649
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met	2.6325468135388466
elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them	2.5854982000597126
for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	3.032345056410116
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them	2.22716683217709
with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to <unk> his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words <unk> " and <unk> " when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be <unk> <unk>	1.7455628235338618
her colour changed and she said no more	1.8067364087501814
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	2.87111664112031
"what will be his surprise " thought she "when he knows who they are	2.3137975938935784
he takes them now for people of fashion	1.7142804820484838
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she <unk> a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his <unk> as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions	2.154434690031884
that he was surprised by the <unk> was evident he <unk> it however with <unk> and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner	2.942727176209282
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph	2.741197668816029
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush	2.9022363209370408
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and <unk> in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners	2.8857920162015778
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <unk> and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport	1.8529220216409523
mrs gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder	2.4907673077650534
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself	2.4049396168120682
her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating "why is he so altered	2.1494117021267214
from what can it proceed	1.6337803150038266
it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened	2.786134075874679
it is impossible that he should still love me	2.472274074918681
after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on <unk> their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water <unk> there <unk> to be a little alteration	2.192345972483447
it originated in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth's arm <unk> to her support and consequently preferred her husband's	2.900323329309119
mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together	2.3374684724267816
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected "for your housekeeper " she added <unk> us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left <unk> we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country	1.6876124757881479
he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling	2.761699813343848
"they will join me early to morrow " he continued "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters	2.430983716009599
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow	1.827326572259831
"there is also one other person in the party " he continued after a pause "who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton	2.1187853261287715
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she <unk> to it	3.3013643623301356
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her	2.1187853261287715
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought	1.8519159931403955
elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased	2.7092996152794995
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind	3.1996021495818265
they soon <unk> the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind	2.918937434108824
he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn	2.547266198304225
at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward	2.7949258113265265
she wanted to talk but there seemed an <unk> on every subject	2.7025490339837908
at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance	2.812391541211247
yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over	2.278332606347697
on mr and mrs gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness	2.761699813343848
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house	2.4158143642938645
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	2.666846889300492
"there is something a little stately in him to be sure " replied her aunt "but it is confined to his air and is not <unk>	3.1829038054614323
i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it	2.4525333803137146
"i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us	2.1180773827977717
it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention	2.969645075631239
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling	2.3538874610127944
"to be sure lizzy " said her aunt "he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham's countenance for his features are perfectly good	2.6963783949019704
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable	2.8963478599839596
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning	2.761699813343848
"but perhaps he may be a little <unk> in his civilities " replied her uncle	3.292063114555854
"your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds	2.701451913163729
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing	2.6356829585399044
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his <unk> when he speaks	2.8072949917755845
and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart	3.1138422025186094
but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most <unk> character	2.991500101182991
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes	1.7382273641134907
but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant <unk> every virtue	2.9752254643720626
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different <unk> and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham's so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire	1.6265507027536246
in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually <unk> her authority but stating it to be such as might be <unk> on	2.6826957952797255
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its <unk> to think of any thing else	1.9429496147158305
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the <unk> of an intercourse renewed after many years <unk>	2.321954250288982
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr darcy's civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister	2.023589647725157
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	2.4244620170823286
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came	2.3515902641499293
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street	1.8957356524063758
nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece	2.848035868435802
while these <unk> born notions were passing in their <unk> the perturbation of elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing	2.230574909604634
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of <unk> she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than <unk> anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	2.053525026457146
she <unk> from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	2.4816289228368253
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place	2.3342491123915554
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	2.540578687003116
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <unk>	2.157862966097306
miss darcy was tall and on a larger <unk> than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance <unk> and <unk>	2.53055464484497
elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by <unk> such different feelings	2.801498991117999
he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done	2.959137939328312
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <unk> than to herself	2.4789485002656217
they had long wished to see him	1.8189717574717585
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention	2.5129665666834007
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love	2.154434690031884
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was <unk> with admiration was evident enough	2.433427565632809
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were <unk> in her favour	1.8738174228603839
bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased	2.1025609162122185
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner	2.594707628941641
sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance	2.629655327362148
but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a <unk> of jane	3.433320018281994
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard	2.0859245544784972
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister	2.1447935256390522
on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious <unk> denoted a recollection of jane not <unk> by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared	2.053525026457146
he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her " and before she could reply he added "it is above eight months	1.9429496147158305
we have not met since the th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield	2.2887895769211113
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when <unk> to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn	2.8555769266709765
there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning	3.296511943220056
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however <unk> its existence might prove had at least <unk> one day	1.6050163175336876
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and <unk> the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible	1.53174046370208
their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country	2.1187853261287715
miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <unk> readily obeyed	2.414700149903275
mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head	2.5433932486232123
presuming however that this studied <unk> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on	2.023589647725157
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends	2.988512395198733
elizabeth <unk> all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little	1.8957356524063758
eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress	2.6273595188337557
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner's curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication	3.2973909377780366
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her	3.046989570903508
they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry	2.048183988120319
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find	3.3588547543582026
they could not be <unk> by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have <unk> it for mr darcy	2.1187853261287715
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight	2.407076702207846
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	2.734291089041399
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were <unk> understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged	1.8329807108324359
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out	2.023589647725157
she certainly did not hate him	1.5484220507112612
no <unk> had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called	2.9389342576783357
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be <unk> to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a <unk> nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced	1.79571449437164
but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked	2.949696883747971
gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the <unk> and <unk> of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection	2.610157215682537
he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest <unk> seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any <unk> display of regard or any <unk> of manner where their two <unk> only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister	1.7782794100389228
such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love <unk> love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means <unk> though it could not be exactly defined	1.968419447286612
she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	1.6876124757881479
they were therefore to go	1.4651810523611792
elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply	2.554731186519931
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon	2.7034145804855947
on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer	2.2567290593679528
its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful <unk> and <unk> <unk> which were scattered over the <unk> lawn	2.761699813343848
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london	2.7350560171345064
georgiana's reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved	2.321954250288982
it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on	2.023589647725157
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard	2.8838578270327173
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself <unk> watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention	3.3130552453744224
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much	2.610157215682537
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room	2.207691753857741
she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine	2.4631601853993557
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat <unk> and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> soon collected them round the table	1.4616223148107232
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of <unk> whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to <unk> she began to regret that he came	1.9187520990478337
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on <unk> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning	2.232735148777284
miss darcy on her brother's entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side	2.3713737056616555
they must be a great loss to your family	2.204503832767371
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was <unk> in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress but <unk> herself <unk> to <unk> the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	1.9429496147158305
while she spoke an <unk> glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes	2.5188423606171186
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have <unk> from the hint but she had merely intended to <unk> elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps	1.539926526059492
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement	2.380513660758704
he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend	2.3713737056616555
elizabeth's collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more	2.5628035981252797
her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully	2.3713737056616555
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was <unk> her feelings in <unk> on elizabeth's person behaviour and dress	2.543345761304649
but georgiana would not join her	1.596476121023065
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable	2.4816289228368253
when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister	3.016139973526858
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy " she cried "i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	2.63845964624686
she is grown so <unk> and <unk>	1.5431410853531973
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again	2.70939017504342
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather <unk> no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer	2.4227418309244415
"for my own part " she <unk> "i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her	2.666140935442108
her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome	2.51367561249132
her <unk> wants character there is nothing marked in its lines	2.2975557174654364
her <unk> are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them	2.942727176209282
they have a sharp <unk> look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self <unk> without fashion which is intolerable	3.174431164398577
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat <unk> she had all the success she expected	2.321954250288982
he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued "i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield ' she a beauty	1.8529220216409523
i should as soon call her mother a wit	1.9710052039741002
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time	2.5289151573965425
"yes " replied darcy who could contain himself no longer "but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	2.4816289228368253
he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	3.083149475960684
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both	2.555525117291239
they talked of his sister his friends his house his <unk> of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject	2.2758459260747883
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere	1.6265507027536246
elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill	2.4575243829044044
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves	2.6548616812042676
the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago	2.2564528872312906
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence	2.4816289228368253
it was to this effect "since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well	2.6826957952797255
what i have to say relates to poor lydia	2.168749035195432
an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham	2.4244620170823286
to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected	2.3514089332807995
i am very very sorry	2.120963160801029
so imprudent a match on both sides	1.527709804192025
but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood	2.8474086756248083
thoughtless and <unk> i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart	2.9173039967424437
his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing	2.4635820749228414
our poor mother is sadly grieved	1.623555175892411
my father bears it better	1.3485813565054823
how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves	2.566488176583975
they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight	2.2757204233170523
the express was sent off directly	1.369682191555373
my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us	2.4004861186161692
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon	1.9959034326898473
lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention	2.3982734089033624
i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother	2.3567601891540026
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written	2.9226928133932026
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on <unk> this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first "by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so <unk> that i cannot answer for being <unk>	1.53174046370208
dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed	2.760627555821412
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland	2.4244620170823286
colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express	2.603603884166017
though lydia's short letter to mrs f	1.811618789993646
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w	2.4095531327445876
never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f	2.580206710813316
he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom	2.288236166367363
all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road	2.897811652722178
i know not what to think	1.6168542425461718
after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f	1.9912762696456747
came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the <unk> and at the <unk> in barnet and <unk> but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through	2.942727176209282
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f	2.3461232800132947
but no one can throw any blame on them	2.106700327402779
our distress my dear lizzy is very great	2.314023974624445
my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him	2.2213018857071525
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing	1.9952623149688797
i grieve to find however that colonel f	1.9643643969227902
was not a man to be trusted	2.6638071745284044
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room	2.096997035317119
could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected	3.2694935854967206
i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return	2.848035868435802
i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient	2.7898198081806216
i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible	2.610157215682537
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former	3.0678136347540423
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her	2.2309457772574777
what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and <unk> way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening	2.2758459260747883
in such an <unk> my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i <unk> upon his goodness	3.04657372115102
where where is my uncle	1.5687811028572756
cried elizabeth <unk> from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without <unk> a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared	2.321954250288982
her pale face and <unk> manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was <unk> by lydia's situation hastily exclaimed "i beg your pardon but i must leave you	2.3713737056616555
i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose	2.606040699922374
cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself "i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner	2.5146316620836613
you are not well enough you cannot go yourself	2.5222243448206276
elizabeth hesitated but her <unk> <unk> under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	2.710070561556781
calling back the servant therefore she <unk> him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost <unk> to fetch his master and mistress home instantly	2.842560110007284
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so <unk> ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and <unk> "let me call your maid	2.232735148777284
is there nothing you could take to give you present relief	2.319701858344353
a glass of wine shall i get you one	1.8972373799722293
you are very ill	1.6236376721332744
"no i thank you " she replied endeavouring to recover herself	2.502322024513601
"there is nothing the matter with me	1.6290385265136138
i am quite well	1.7347001202090575
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	2.733995164007461
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word	2.7304799739777668
darcy in wretched suspense could only say something <unk> of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence	2.6937547341984254
at length she spoke again	1.5962603872224335
it cannot be concealed from any one	2.2725655459120833
my youngest sister has left all her friends has <unk> has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham	2.44131728089138
they are gone off together from brighton	1.9426413960900475
you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever	2.430539137270562
darcy was fixed in astonishment	1.4931560690413561
"when i consider " she added in a yet more agitated voice "that i might have prevented it	2.6805177432914293
i who knew what he was	1.6692404764556419
had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family	2.724015447780297
had his character been known this could not have happened	2.566376085563464
but it is all all too late now	2.8439260065111585
"i am grieved indeed " cried darcy <unk> shocked	1.9722241763377346
but is it certain absolutely certain	1.6721232607564431
they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland	2.2692509658448956
"and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her	2.159118885221092
"my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour	2.600432087829388
how is such a man to be worked on	2.28000054934446
how are they even to be discovered	1.884198941270104
i have not the smallest hope	2.6024769332765985
it is every way <unk>	1.4549772958911296
darcy shook his head in silent <unk>	1.8211087878032044
"when my eyes were opened to his real character	1.7897516977721106
had i known what i ought what i dared to do	2.1051414538070303
but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much	2.4677187368662796
he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest <unk> his <unk> contracted his air gloomy	2.6988562060328
elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it	1.635605120110517
her power was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace	2.269713721295314
she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing <unk> to her <unk> afforded no <unk> of her distress	3.119514094866708
it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain	2.6826957952797255
but self though it would intrude could not <unk> her	2.290369894935708
lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon <unk> up every private care and covering her face with her <unk> elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern	1.4440241885954521
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress	2.2828344082098755
but i will not <unk> you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks	2.6568028821167538
this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day	2.62146190629921
be so kind as to <unk> for us to miss darcy	2.602857740536975
say that urgent business <unk> us home immediately	1.773198039450435
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible	2.16813544374761
i know it cannot be long	2.417788088825179
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a <unk> glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of <unk> and <unk> <unk> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <unk> its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination	1.6050163175336876
if gratitude and esteem are good <unk> of affection elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty	2.3532385349210085
but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been <unk> nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps <unk> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment	1.5237960002208242
be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business	2.69304269152213
never since reading jane's second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her	2.213430019708434
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement	2.659157650127732
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible	2.232735148777284
but now it was all too natural	2.49791539462388
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey	1.968419447286612
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body	2.848035868435802
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion	2.3637602538927154
her affections had been continually <unk> but never without an object	2.096337854998528
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl	1.8176059206693767
how acutely did she now feel it	1.7092438742975415
she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so <unk> a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe	1.5483652565854986
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but <unk> them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with <unk> energy	1.9429496147158305
though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected	3.002218098558354
not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power	2.6355226823704783
elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being <unk> by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled	2.473039296019609
they were to be off as soon as possible	3.230582908907153
"but what is to be done about pemberley	2.5688361282614203
<unk> told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so	2.582850619283794
"yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement	2.8947826303724513
that is all settled	1.7185460393097758
"that is all settled " repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare	2.5106640738167822
"and are they upon such terms as for her to <unk> the real truth	3.106736661025753
but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour	2.51527319121483
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were <unk> to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure	1.79571449437164
an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a <unk> space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn	1.8139306939110624
"i have been thinking it over again elizabeth " said her uncle as they drove from the town "and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter	2.321954250288982
it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means <unk> or <unk> and who was actually staying in his <unk> family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward	1.8738174228603839
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster	2.157031491760897
his temptation is not <unk> to the risk	3.189916404907221
"do you really think so	1.4972359777946154
cried elizabeth <unk> up for a moment	2.1209745714144193
"upon my word " said mrs gardiner "i begin to be of your uncle's opinion	3.005853891457969
it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it	2.618282217229526
i cannot think so very ill of wickham	1.8387656292607322
can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it	2.0477457142455195
"not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable	2.239869547837115
if indeed it should be so	1.8745222333840104
but i dare not hope it	1.8731036288130292
"in the first place " replied mr gardiner "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland	2.420320456898535
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption	2.2117914276459882
and besides no <unk> of them were to be found on the barnet road	2.871683167530985
"well then supposing them to be in london	1.9050143539291406
they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more <unk> purpose	2.656448674554674
"but why all this secrecy	1.6870092997831445
why any fear of detection	1.4899784630035344
why must their marriage be private	1.6193431161568235
no no this is not likely	1.960805511917062
his most particular friend you see by jane's account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her	2.327453088405128
wickham will never marry a woman without some money	2.1258541516025686
he cannot afford it	1.2107555130883172
and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake <unk> every chance of <unk> himself by marrying well	2.4940585378714952
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce	2.4816289228368253
but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good	2.8169545739427995
"but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage	2.8417935887674775
but really i know not what to say	1.7893588201603632
perhaps i am not doing her justice	2.6620975747613764
but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity	2.610157215682537
she has been allowed to <unk> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	3.296550053117024
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head	2.480834061950036
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it	3.2328171827003787
<unk> to her feelings which are naturally lively enough	2.497810240437253
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can <unk> a woman	2.5711803527462465
"but you see that jane " said her aunt "does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt	2.671378700599184
"of whom does jane ever think ill	1.64538518071605
and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them	2.7803638121218603
but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is	2.4592614710223124
that he has neither integrity nor honour	2.035756263713448
that he is as false and deceitful as he is <unk>	3.2305628417394807
"and do you really know all this	2.3217216435689467
cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	2.493825703522581
"i do indeed " replied elizabeth colouring	2.4548349557483857
yet he knew to the contrary himself	1.9799247890592397
he must know that she was as amiable and <unk> as we have found her	3.66635970655848
"but does lydia know nothing of this	1.8106735490058206
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand	2.6361319917784147
that that is the worst of all	2.1637844112400906
till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself	3.214593893360983
and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time	2.7108709618947935
as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown	2.023589647725157
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me	2.7651620127272634
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	3.108740550485466
that such a consequence as this should <unk> you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts	2.536501635038564
"not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been <unk> you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away	2.4244620170823286
when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were	2.596707183501032
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites	1.79571449437164
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent	1.8530655267239837
they <unk> as expeditiously as possible and <unk> one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day	2.7195345374328643
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been <unk> by long expectations	3.500873906844475
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that <unk> up their faces and displayed itself over their whole <unk> in a variety of <unk> and <unk> was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	1.7455628235338618
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears <unk> the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the <unk>	2.5209293683218164
"not yet " replied jane	1.4307866227013835
"but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well	2.5133479213633922
"is my father in town	1.5334740778191454
"yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word	2.157679108439903
"and have you heard from him often	2.0494229427877793
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in <unk> and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do	3.290344562312668
he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention	2.3965352002492226
"and my mother how is she	1.6812653594830813
how are you all	1.6264848793510325
"my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken	2.1839433060682847
she does not yet leave her dressing room	2.1478886448920504
mary and kitty thank heaven	1.842576549300411
"but you how are you	1.4130371739938936
how much you must have gone through	2.4621446566866414
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party	2.3713737056616555
when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give	2.848035868435802
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet <unk> her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their <unk> and perhaps announce the marriage	1.9952623149688797
mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret <unk> against the <unk> conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing	1.7301957388458942
"if i had been able " said she "to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her	2.610157215682537
why did the <unk> ever let her go out of their sight	2.389717381733132
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after	2.848035868435802
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over <unk> as i always am	3.178813082460779
and now <unk> mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all	2.6894674449180087
they all exclaimed against such <unk> ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia	2.1187853261287715
"do not give way to useless alarm " added he "though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain	2.7156671732951394
it is not quite a week since they left brighton	2.8084643720107474
my dear brother " replied mrs bennet "that is exactly what i could most wish for	2.2358631399780706
and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry	2.805274379336414
and above all things keep mr bennet from <unk>	2.051388724433866
and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses	3.0282232759865333
oh brother how kind you are	1.489823659887321
i know you will contrive it all	1.725874185946302
but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters	1.7455628235338618
in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before	2.9087034089721495
one came from her books and the other from her toilette	2.4668932517785978
the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself <unk> in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty	2.085205857248754
as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table "this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of	2.4244620170823286
but we must <unk> the tide of malice and <unk> into the wounded <unk> of each other the <unk> of sisterly consolation	3.106812043011933
mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral <unk> from the evil before them	2.5227965328414097
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly <unk> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy	2.543345761304649
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <unk> of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying "but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard	1.968419447286612
give me farther particulars	1.2823323238468505
what did colonel forster say	1.5456187163743178
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place	2.2219282736868133
i am so grieved for him	1.837771879493293
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey	2.192345972483447
"and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry	1.940204036442571
did he know of their intending to go off	2.0859927841468355
had colonel forster seen denny himself	1.6365358622893966
"yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it	2.5968664625727786
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before	3.3667651099598244
"and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married	2.79821130750863
"how was it possible that such an idea should enter our <unk>	2.4521590796818846
my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be	2.3858824979004183
kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a step	3.0676746485480986
she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks	2.937055027246534
"no i believe not	1.4022143142735093
"and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself	2.270586360882341
does he know his real character	1.4282015288975451
"i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did	2.8243231243640645
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant	2.3025439208571017
and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false	2.6154278211510222
"but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable	2.353988681984614
we acted with the best intentions	1.75820008151713
"he brought it with him for us to see	2.576849074874641
jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth	2.2286670177737213
these were the contents "my dear harriet "you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed	2.6826957952797255
i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel	2.6826957952797255
i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off	2.628510465911925
what a good joke it will be	1.7266237925541552
i can hardly write for laughing	1.9172789494167293
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure	3.1262672215937797
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell <unk> to mend a great <unk> in my worked muslin gown before they are <unk> up	2.848035868435802
give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey	2.5592026049934877
"your affectionate friend "lydia bennet	1.3498763894378758
"what a letter is this to be written at such a moment	2.3845113912958396
but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey	2.935988729422498
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy	3.1768799712503704
how he must have felt it	2.115383084510799
"i never saw any one so shocked	1.9213598432400227
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes	2.2695253154552835
my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion	2.4547071186947482
jane " cried elizabeth "was there a servant <unk> to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day	3.000453307325915
"i do not know	1.3919532638655203
i hope there was	1.2934627783779444
but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my <unk>	2.2801904009534826
"your attendance upon her has been too much for you	2.301156347410967
you do not look well	2.9154783896325567
that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone	2.8762500454597277
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me	2.8687115579746103
she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her <unk> or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us	2.192345972483447
"she had better have <unk> at home " cried elizabeth "perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one's neighbours	2.767025247271426
let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied	1.9964176517102152
"he meant i believe " replied jane "to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the <unk> and try if any thing could be made out from them	2.881900041480893
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham	2.420236005805255
it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be <unk> he meant to make enquiries at clapham	2.6826957952797255
if he could any how discover at what house the <unk> had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach	2.3713737056616555
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this	2.3713737056616555
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	3.149716844757429
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most <unk> and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion	2.8036758880899737
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain	2.9440284628768776
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	2.1630238781065856
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a <unk>	1.7615770326037883
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be <unk> to her nieces	3.335038320764918
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom	2.8557607390755555
their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and <unk> them up though as she never came without <unk> some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or <unk> she seldom went away without leaving them more <unk> than she found them	2.023589647725157
all meryton seemed striving to <unk> the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light	2.6560567695900796
he was declared to be in debt to every <unk> in the place and his <unk> all honoured with the title of <unk> had been extended into every <unk> family	3.162277660168379
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them	1.615598098439874
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal <unk> in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings	1.8329807108324359
mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it	2.6814332669674434
he added that mr bennet seemed wholly <unk> at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon	2.6097313915796008
there was also a postscript to this effect	1.7373869996123847
"i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young man's <unk> in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself	2.053525026457146
if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a <unk> as that it might be of essential consequence	2.8384518852188823
at present we have nothing to guide us	2.09358585754807
colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head	2.8219142385595744
but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person	2.3372405694923226
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved	2.6826957952797255
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years	2.730726646148273
it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to	2.4816289228368253
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected	2.7722205832851476
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience	2.516472010519863
through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance	2.804914203600854
it was as follows "my dear sir "i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous <unk> you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire	2.192345972483447
be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely <unk> with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the <unk> kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	2.3713737056616555
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can <unk> so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most <unk> to a <unk> mind	2.6826957952797255
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	2.9598121858272353
and it is the more to be <unk> because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte <unk> me that this <unk> of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an <unk> at so early an age	1.566048452832833
<unk> that may be you are <unk> to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair	2.610157215682537
they agree with me in <unk> that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the <unk> of all the others for who as lady catherine herself <unk> says will connect themselves with such a family	2.4816289228368253
let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to <unk> the fruits of her own <unk> offence	2.4816289228368253
"i am dear sir c	1.5050234844115216
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	2.562631874559167
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living	3.3121288033994163
his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them	3.162277660168379
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him	2.6331748612788606
and in the wretched state of his own <unk> there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia's relations for it had just <unk> that he had left <unk> debts behind him to a very considerable amount	2.154434690031884
he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable	2.5720972664346524
mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror	2.4336433107234603
"this is wholly unexpected	1.278432417379868
i had not an idea of it	2.5289074364634434
mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday	2.963710566231924
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in <unk> intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit	2.192345972483447
when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before	3.2051176282627925
"what is he coming home and without poor lydia	1.977656796101541
<unk> he will not leave london before he has found them	2.6310159455111255
who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away	2.42453257179608
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it	2.942727176209282
the coach therefore took them the first <unk> of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn	2.646567768895447
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	2.610157215682537
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley	2.1513910595975814
it would have spared her she thought one <unk> night out of two	2.2252615443844252
when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual <unk> composure	2.798818951707593
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it	2.4244620170823286
it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied "say nothing of that	2.4244620170823286
who should suffer but myself	1.375863691733806
it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it	2.8887017457324804
"you must not be too severe upon yourself " replied elizabeth	2.33069264563922
"you may well warn me against such an evil	1.8614629044580218
human nature is so prone to fall into it	1.9260711254047502
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	2.260769498868724
it will pass away soon enough	1.544076672078058
"do you suppose them to be in london	1.9352092284653655
"yes where else can they be so well concealed	1.9748135542919727
"and lydia used to want to go to london " added kitty	2.349439209327682
"she is happy then " said her father drily "and her residence there will probably be of some duration	2.5413956062386034
then after a short silence he continued "lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind	2.465271078506676
"this is a parade " cried he "which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune	2.4094461907517037
i would not trust you so near it as <unk> <unk> for fifty pounds	2.8987476501712592
no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it	2.493733166514868
no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village	2.1498887328576415
balls will be absolutely <unk> unless you stand up with one of your sisters	2.269175786142097
and you are never to <unk> out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner	3.0475260480219797
kitty who took all these <unk> in a serious light began to <unk>	2.4773593227998085
"well well " said he "do not make yourself unhappy	2.484033715090732
if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them	2.963985981935245
"what do you mean hill	1.887968922997977
"dear madam " cried mrs hill in great astonishment "don't you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner	2.435674881748067
he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter	2.444430232267868
away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech	2.2736639058837422
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from <unk> to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the <unk> who said "if you are looking for my master ma'am he is walking towards the little copse	1.8329807108324359
upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	2.4780279153548683
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister <unk> for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out "oh papa what news	2.543345761304649
have you heard from my uncle	1.8081324765259341
"yes i have had a letter from him by express	2.863833247630088
"well and what news does it bring	1.877660002177711
"what is there of good to be expected	1.9815060989925455
said he taking the letter from his pocket "but perhaps you would like to read it	2.365384474562474
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	1.815288704703891
jane now came up	1.2178272325106025
<unk> it aloud " said their father "for i hardly know myself what it is about	2.4003531034982473
"gracechurch street monday <unk>	1.1650584830526505
"my dear brother "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction	2.702739633421625
soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were	2.637252595783873
the particulars i reserve till we meet	1.5789557118832789
it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both " "then it is as i always hoped " cried jane "they are married	2.76248566542726
elizabeth read on "i have seen them both	1.7525001092375496
they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are	2.232735148777284
all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum	1.9429496147158305
these are <unk> which considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you	2.780171145756309
i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer	2.3765773779680828
you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be	2.4118093720590794
the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune	2.4816289228368253
if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement	2.6063017103136703
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my <unk> and care	3.2628286433548412
send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write <unk>	2.4233316116504766
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve	2.7337022645305233
she comes to us to day	1.8158586758329087
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on	2.538244397435054
"can it be possible that he will marry her	2.3961981949055633
"wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him " said her sister	2.734355234368752
"my dear father i congratulate you	1.5536337822445896
"and have you answered the letter	1.8878700152162637
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote	2.2364077575214463
my dear father " she cried "come back and write immediately	2.4323045794677576
consider how important every moment is in such a case	2.103086159207078
"let me write for you " said jane "if you dislike the trouble yourself	2.73433735172873
"i dislike it very much " he replied "but it must be done	2.688573884861102
and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house	1.898439490866813
"and may i ask	1.1041229557575356
said elizabeth "but the terms i suppose must be complied with	2.6200215356259946
i am only ashamed of his asking so little	2.224964933900113
"and they must marry	1.2905848437333387
yet he is such a man	1.6997165859856334
"yes yes they must marry	1.440713974017035
there is nothing else to be done	2.4486079115259964
but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him	2.610157215682537
cried jane "what do you mean sir	1.775669521761111
"i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone	2.5663953376158006
"that is very true " said elizabeth "though it had not occurred to me before	2.6499875979319683
his debts to be discharged and something still to remain	1.915085865182385
it must be my uncle's doings	2.649357847527016
generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself	2.2140150983075286
"no " said her father <unk> a fool if he takes her with a <unk> less than ten thousand pounds	2.910521815994616
i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	2.88352854384055
how is half such a sum to be repaid	1.9249600701822456
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house	1.7774348032374327
their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room	2.498914149394285
"and they are really to be married	1.9726759661754565
cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves	2.39416860476854
"how strange this is	1.217938117318019
and for this we are to be thankful	2.1724798744758522
that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice	2.6330439711672424
"i comfort myself with thinking " replied jane "that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her	2.7395782410860776
though our kind uncle has done something towards <unk> him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced	2.770953401178205
he has children of his own and may have more	2.6447309298321318
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds	1.5926831578202756
"if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been " said elizabeth "and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not <unk> of his own	2.154434690031884
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <unk>	2.8245794616485327
their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	2.6965072658367353
by this time she is actually with them	2.1989855355623833
if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy	2.33681921618263
what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt	2.1519686367188244
"we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side " said jane "i hope and trust they will yet be happy	2.3405809598724265
his <unk> to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking	3.1729275067831737
their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten	2.6095883278247127
<unk> conduct has been such " replied elizabeth "as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget	2.4361979074006705
it is useless to talk of it	1.7354911865167821
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened	2.473871886528753
they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	3.095072043892473
he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied <unk> as you please	2.264866908730759
"may we take my uncle's letter to read to her	2.017770485854794
"take whatever you like and get away	1.678950910058595
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together	2.4944868153895428
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communication would therefore do for all	2.5106730366773284
after a slight <unk> for good news the letter was read aloud	2.330715226773488
mrs bennet could hardly contain herself	1.9530875566705261
as soon as jane had read mr gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its <unk>	2.8223750290203378
to know that her daughter would be married was enough	2.8790283661773395
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	2.72858671401569
"my dear dear lydia	1.3632010968114452
she cried "this is delightful indeed	1.5533200952334243
she will be married	2.1357895676840326
my good kind brother	1.3353927951791837
and to see dear wickham too	1.743484555550085
but the clothes the wedding clothes	1.5684640732115371
lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her	2.645471936986655
stay stay i will go myself	1.9946828722615504
ring the bell kitty for hill	1.788802651220967
i will put on my things in a moment	1.9331636915281805
my dear dear lydia	1.3181472518034458
how merry we shall be together when we meet	2.324620121452567
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiner's behaviour laid them all under	2.479663406698284
"for we must attribute this happy conclusion " she added "in a great measure to his kindness	2.471456203239884
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money	2.5465964939805072
"well " cried her mother "it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle	2.7289708124717658
if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents	2.3713737056616555
i am so happy	1.254403747212966
in a short time i shall have a daughter married	2.565932625164606
how well it <unk>	1.2245305516174967
and she was only sixteen last june	3.0193575221435953
my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i can't write so i will <unk> and you write for me	3.16012788571827
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately	2.279881745917143
one day's delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual	2.826613339656397
other schemes too came into her head	1.7629001192885791
"i will go to meryton " said she "as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips	3.1334767117952294
and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long	2.601459510280977
kitty run down and order the carriage	1.692720538909921
an <unk> would do me a great deal of good i am sure	1.8783049857358163
girls can i do any thing for you in meryton	2.4708919978957673
my dear hill have you heard the good news	2.2156422202710018
mrs hill began instantly to express her joy	1.9597111204347926
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took <unk> in her own room that she might think with freedom	2.90341799756397
poor lydia's situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful	2.8195914232919956
she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained	2.192345972483447
mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an <unk> sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she <unk> him	2.321954250288982
he now wished it more than ever	1.8903544332733007
had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her	2.515792524127679
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great <unk> to be her husband might then have <unk> in its proper place	3.3002617688682405
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	1.9952623149688797
when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son	2.8203876560734074
this son was to join in <unk> off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for	2.920636800219241
five daughters <unk> entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years after lydia's birth had been certain that he would	2.850542876821577
this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving	2.673594869496985
mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their <unk> their income	2.5025262611133763
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children	2.4395632709539217
but in what <unk> it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents	2.6372669265402555
this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennet could have no hesitation in <unk> to the proposal before him	3.162277660168379
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to <unk> the engagements that had been made for him	2.321954250288982
he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement	2.86363109603679
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the <unk> by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her <unk> and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother's hands lydia's expences had been very little within that sum	1.9952623149688797
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	2.6826957952797255
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence	2.4396936200974824
his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in <unk> business he was quick in its execution	2.427535637240066
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her	2.8783428480219624
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the <unk> old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain	1.9187520990478337
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits <unk> high	2.942727176209282
no sentiment of shame gave a <unk> to her triumph	2.771996370985117
the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <unk> of elegant nuptials fine <unk> new carriages and servants	2.154434690031884
she was busily <unk> through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance	2.450271699906161
<unk> park might do " said she "if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at <unk> if the drawing room were larger but <unk> is too far off	2.7772779204265277
into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have <unk>	2.1625561025374522
i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn	2.5360653548350776
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a <unk> to buy clothes for his daughter	2.4816289228368253
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion	2.327908192515452
that his anger could be carried to such a point of <unk> resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem <unk> exceeded all that she could believe possible	2.6826957952797255
she had no fear of its <unk> farther through his means	2.979816594350013
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <unk> depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's <unk> would have mortified her so much	2.761699813343848
not however from any fear of disadvantage from it <unk> to herself for at any rate there seemed a <unk> <unk> between them	2.871151990752738
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should <unk>	3.9121896319373013
the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a <unk> as this	3.014383759024058
she was humbled she was grieved she <unk> though she hardly knew of what	2.3527140529378823
she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it	2.546754518415564
she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence	2.841642746020896
he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex	2.607096498713703
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph	2.5016836626119376
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her	2.879268516940336
his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes	2.3404994803041497
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance	2.154434690031884
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <unk> what <unk> felicity really was	2.829109392503981
an union of a different tendency and <unk> the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family	2.8525305917193915
mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	1.4557992647110554
to mr bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with <unk> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again	2.6826957952797255
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia	3.279592463432725
"it was greatly my wish that he should do so " he added "as soon as his marriage was fixed on	2.8083663016672817
and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my niece's	2.620802741531957
it is mr wickham's intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army	2.6050131742976035
he has the promise of an <unk> in general 's regiment now quartered in the north	2.4713931105244327
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom	3.103159486083731
he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent	2.698419273184451
i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present <unk> and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy <unk> for which i have pledged myself	2.321954250288982
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall <unk> a list according to his information	2.7501031263431717
haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week	2.023134485489976
they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the <unk>	2.761699813343848
she is well and <unk> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother	2.9317158753965313
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do	2.701942304260448
but mrs bennet was not so well pleased with it	3.104152666466883
lydia's being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their <unk> in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites	1.715437896342879
"she is so fond of mrs forster " said she "it will be quite shocking to send her away	2.629524477431142
and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much	2.440152485481126
the officers may not be so pleasant in general 's regiment	2.3641816863656824
his daughter's request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative	2.6280903495151833
but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so <unk> to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished	1.6744824380115346
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north	3.0886804324141974
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn	2.761699813343848
elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes	2.848035868435802
their sister's wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself	2.878099351477344
the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner time	3.1322610688704366
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the <unk> was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <unk>	2.4244620170823286
the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them	2.600813154594076
smiles <unk> the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy	2.5788600471641705
her mother <unk> <unk> embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	2.4244620170823286
their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial	2.7949224059527253
the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him	2.563424715540665
she turned from sister to sister <unk> their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there	2.1187853261287715
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all	2.192345972483447
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no <unk> in future to the impudence of an <unk> man	2.792696580112074
she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who <unk> their confusion suffered no variation of colour	2.483675585978861
there was no want of discourse	2.3583337933163757
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her <unk>	2.232735148777284
nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world	2.719480572935867
"only think of its being three months " she cried "since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time	2.7742450489366357
when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again	2.8691220144509093
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was	2.5121612352745206
her father lifted up his eyes	1.899151572569564
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued "oh	2.4492239438589873
mamma do the people here <unk> know i am married to day	2.2565067809865686
i was afraid they might not and we <unk> william <unk> in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my <unk> and let my hand just rest upon the window <unk> so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing	1.715437896342879
elizabeth could bear it no longer	1.6919715446272756
she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour	2.634886770332475
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mother's right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister "ah	2.825524429926508
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good spirits increased	2.9584714188292542
she longed to see mrs philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called "mrs wickham " by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two <unk>	1.9952623149688797
"well mamma " said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room "and what do you think of my husband	3.0453402562637666
is not he a charming man	1.8077048046441715
i am sure my sisters must all envy me	2.910492108846947
i only hope they may have half my good luck	2.3074933411724823
they must all go to brighton	1.5766828749087474
that is the place to get husbands	2.2235270314349007
what a pity it is mamma we did not all go	2.060764463466635
but my dear lydia i don't at all like your going such a way off	2.7663758566316208
must it be so	1.269390936160934
yes there is nothing in that	2.3547400278412374
you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us	2.2205391360375777
we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all	2.9695895902137774
"i should like it beyond any thing	1.8001933462358997
"and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over	2.73151812951586
"i thank you for my share of the favour " said elizabeth "but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands	3.157377208145604
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them	2.24783725751682
mr wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight	3.0074604920917687
no one but mrs bennet <unk> that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home	2.761699813343848
these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not	2.506915280476115
wickham's affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydia's for him	2.7029486444097666
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to <unk> with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	1.4942339672143998
lydia was exceedingly fond of him	1.5411587168113783
he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him	2.798896702058766
he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would <unk> more birds on the first of <unk> than any body else in the country	3.290344562312668
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth "lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe	2.7872246055992385
you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it	2.401908094082777
are not you curious to hear how it was <unk>	2.207924033268696
you are so strange	1.5498477786674192
we were married you know at st <unk> because wickham's lodgings were in that parish	2.3117178868953334
and it was settled that we should all be there by <unk> o'clock	2.523762837491451
well monday morning came and i was in such a <unk>	2.6986513270764045
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted	3.1582269381737462
and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon	2.6334461095035073
however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham	2.767863524133738
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat	3.159692297432049
"well and so we <unk> at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them	2.4244620170823286
if <unk> believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight	2.734187485121321
to be sure london was rather thin but however the little <unk> was open	2.7868214439539796
well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone	2.9034177485299826
and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it	2.602299285344224
well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day	2.761699813343848
but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out	2.524508789917407
however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well	3.0037241447644187
repeated elizabeth in utter amazement	1.449893914638163
he was to come there with wickham you know	2.6589712018126432
i ought not to have said a word about it	1.7902123420577258
i promised them so <unk>	1.4717460107431188
it was to be such a secret	2.873113055644662
"if it was to be secret " said jane "say not another word on the subject	2.8583383828281548
you may depend upon my seeking no further	1.7331393931872083
certainly " said elizabeth though <unk> with curiosity "we will ask you no questions	2.8419970723659267
"thank you " said lydia "for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry	2.664118622941162
on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away	2.2062539418166764
mr darcy had been at her sister's wedding	2.8146608191960296
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none	3.0087469944951803
"you may readily comprehend " she added "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time	2.4244620170823286
"not that i shall though " she added to herself as she finished the letter "and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to <unk> and <unk> to find it out	2.2758459260747883
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante	2.2758459260747883
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could	2.697627970489707
she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the <unk> and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial	1.9952623149688797
"my dear niece "i have just received your letter and shall <unk> this whole morning to answering it as i <unk> that a little writing will not <unk> what i have to tell you	2.761699813343848
i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you	2.4049527775308617
don't think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side	2.806884823881634
if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence	2.4837017494349043
your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done	3.0011150050776716
but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit	2.7120195572449552
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor	2.9235738644449927
mr darcy called and was shut up with him several hours	2.3441499394959826
he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once	2.942727176209282
from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of <unk> for them	2.6058307866360493
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham's <unk> had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or <unk> in him	2.4816289228368253
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world	2.6189206960363824
his character was to speak for itself	2.1837905661857464
if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him	3.3487385726197467
he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us	2.2758459260747883
this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town	2.8651363442486866
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted	3.114514359438568
she would not betray her trust i suppose without <unk> and <unk> for she really did know where her friend was to be found	3.4683778044476576
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her	2.9379425760381985
they were in street	1.927547690634613
he saw wickham and afterwards <unk> on seeing lydia	2.0650179351694247
his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go	2.232735148777284
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was	1.9729644031636606
she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham	2.6691644441181617
she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when	3.122395089128115
since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and <unk> a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design	2.877026428109599
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill <unk> of lydia's flight on her own folly alone	2.6007557509826533
he meant to <unk> his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it	3.24161034319716
he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on	3.2491734563800034
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once	2.782492988355889
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage	3.290344562312668
but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country	2.798262887589764
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief	2.6846466999248086
they met several times for there was much to be discussed	2.1563563641155565
every thing being settled between them mr darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home	2.875941518756216
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily <unk> seeing him till after the departure of the former	2.942727176209282
he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business	3.135282581489959
on saturday he came again	1.6034988366066205
your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together	3.139081833756345
they met again on sunday and then i saw him too	2.487485876338691
it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn	3.3489868016037563
but our visitor was very obstinate	1.6337336789733008
he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one	2.64650785638506
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole	2.4816289228368253
they <unk> it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved	2.717909709602152
but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went <unk> against the <unk> and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his <unk> <unk> and give the praise where it was due	1.6050163175336876
but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people	2.641167386379051
his debts are to be paid <unk> i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased	2.7802195859069143
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above	3.1554975658336057
perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or <unk> reserve can be answerable for the event	2.7315886850461433
but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair	2.610157215682537
when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish	2.1187853261287715
i believe i have now told you every thing	2.007453779752692
lydia came to us and wickham had constant <unk> to the house	2.959568509598432
he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane's letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain	1.6618362775387496
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family	3.046989570903508
i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her	2.4610624738116487
mr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding	2.5877680036208988
he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday	2.7801727056326384
will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him	3.0184878442039405
his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire	2.78928607161947
his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry <unk> his wife may teach him	2.680119023091228
i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name	2.093623282571234
but slyness seems the fashion	1.3814330189555057
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park	2.605345819650545
a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing	2.288504771950618
but i must write no more	2.0304661190760167
the children have been wanting me this half hour	1.6999414804779276
your's very sincerely <unk>	1.2302404088712835
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share	2.647041340699792
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem	2.7844839385966527
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her	2.6092615683476197
every kind of pride must <unk> from the connection	2.697945292964211
she was ashamed to think how much	1.6439134810130858
but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief	2.533476115767566
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned	1.8139306939110624
it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return	2.9520637079316505
they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him	2.262562063625001
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every <unk> speech she had ever directed towards him	2.5622482033188114
for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him	2.7307655258378496
she read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again	1.998007580223152
she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself	2.773075207022501
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one's approach and before she could strike into another path she was <unk> by wickham	2.689987323527812
"i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister	2.1221283493843015
said he as he joined her	1.7122479488756261
"you certainly do " she replied with a smile "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome	2.8061333018678005
"i should be sorry indeed if it were	2.097031981630357
we were always good friends and now we are better	2.2370451677000243
are the others coming out	1.5232867733778888
"i do not know	1.3919532638655203
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton	2.824934828537979
and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley	2.956113705540884
"i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle	3.105868169343601
and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose	1.8702494255933384
but of course she did not mention my name to you	2.65265342592613
"and what did she say	1.6093914758113155
"that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well	2.883240051098221
at such a distance as that you know things are <unk> misrepresented	2.9096774395626075
elizabeth hoped she had <unk> him but he soon afterwards said "i was surprised to see darcy in town last month	2.9638488403386622
we passed each other several times	1.4800514481142548
i wonder what he can be doing there	1.919389200403103
"perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh " said elizabeth	2.180090110194924
"it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year	2.5477377517751116
did you see him while you were at lambton	2.311378819184635
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had	2.326610410213633
"yes he introduced us to his sister	1.7496957746645532
"and do you like her	2.0023758983777284
"i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two	2.3899496686395465
when i last saw her she was not very promising	2.771497119379079
i am very glad you liked her	1.8045333335854685
i hope she will turn out well	1.7165097556951854
"i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age	2.80985660417572
"did you go by the village of <unk>	1.8873141444773252
"i do not recollect that we did	2.7419127487827453
"i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had	2.7789558883000547
a most delightful place	1.5909380797608492
i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing	2.930034055999267
one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me	3.337867467460567
the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness	2.4803758377351137
but it was not to be	1.7857917411948776
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent	2.2501636725044225
"i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron	3.313093627381639
yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember	2.9441089331855146
and it was not wholly without foundation	3.0272328039185687
you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it	2.5932007409196567
they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sister's sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile "come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know	2.023589647725157
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house	2.3675890646610696
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet	2.2758459260747883
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth	2.192345972483447
my dear lydia " she cried "when shall we meet again	2.6221730736682725
not these two or three years perhaps	1.9537750029143506
<unk> to me very often my dear	1.8808435325492556
"as often as i can	1.6206657182366746
but you know married women have never much time for writing	2.0675442613419284
mr wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's	2.013386516359339
he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things	1.9237158854876508
"he is as fine a fellow " said mr bennet as soon as they were out of the house "as ever i saw	2.7189185295124316
he <unk> and <unk> and makes love to us all	2.8895576993560748
i am prodigiously proud of him	1.3765618180911923
i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law	2.164923991284747
"i often think " said she "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends	2.505176042619971
"this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter " said elizabeth	2.259990826333223
"it is no such thing	1.5927296867955223
lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off	2.8174965648347454
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation	2.6826957952797255
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks	2.5292173875922264
mrs bennet was quite in the <unk>	2.7571170888223575
she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns	2.3409687875992335
"well so much the better	1.34491678527971
not that i care about it though	2.330739096241532
he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again	2.547631350529127
but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it	3.098471045460684
and who knows what may happen	1.5913187360229506
but that is nothing to us	2.1349900154909913
you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it	2.0482394779316015
and so is it quite certain he is coming	2.066020559777921
"you may depend on it " replied the other "for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true	2.232735148777284
he comes down on thursday at the <unk> very likely on wednesday	2.4441267650038645
she was going to the <unk> she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of <unk> just fit to be killed	3.046989570903508
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour	3.5075277890526064
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said "i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed	2.085205857248754
but don't imagine it was from any silly cause	2.0157987905862016
i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain	2.2094045479088247
i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him	2.7541681576954766
not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people's remarks	2.8803133618670387
elizabeth did not know what to make of it	2.27978204106815
"yet it is hard " she sometimes thought "that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally <unk> without raising all this <unk>	2.6172288333065175
i will leave him to himself	1.6169599986452388
in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it	3.046989570903508
they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them	2.4445205108614845
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again	2.6854808418561475
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield	2.4873971520234885
"'tis an etiquette i despise " said he	1.5575038570060635
"if he wants our society let him seek it	1.8210909631663998
he knows where we live	1.4741732101701872
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again	2.517301562422981
"well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him	2.941996850223799
but however that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined	2.3042049207243394
we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon	2.341108195348702
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they did	2.610157215682537
as the day of his arrival drew near "i begin to be sorry that he comes at all " said jane to her sister	3.011231019735951
"it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of	2.7955205687407694
happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over	2.0835330414914774
"i wish i could say any thing to comfort you " replied elizabeth "but it is wholly out of my power	2.787014097326431
you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a <unk> is denied me because you have always so much	2.8396515687973816
mrs bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could	2.7674585020803644
she <unk> the days that must <unk> before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before	2.5527623861194613
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house	2.5222043102545064
jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw mr darcy with him and sat down again by her sister	2.848035868435802
"there is a gentleman with him mamma " said kitty "who can it be	2.3722600438834607
replied kitty "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before	2.253016412960323
mr <unk> his name	1.401961750820151
that tall proud man	1.2224638775739767
and so it does i <unk>	1.764062487507717
well any friend of mr bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him	2.8964288832505733
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern	2.2120152971471425
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <unk> letter	2.7826064335881595
both sisters were uncomfortable enough	1.4540756238346306
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiner's letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him	2.610157215682537
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had <unk> but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <unk> and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley	1.6744824380115346
her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first <unk> his altered behaviour in derbyshire	2.848035868435802
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added <unk> to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be <unk>	2.154434690031884
but she would not be secure	2.6684298499649133
"let me first see how he behaves " said she "it will then be early enough for expectation	2.47501860773695
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door	2.485770249182742
on the gentlemen's appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance	2.5445389712593682
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command	2.7365348229455253
she had ventured only one glance at darcy	1.7422799937944426
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley	2.867255281516939
but perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	2.791999389776758
it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture	2.6684671334945445
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	2.364465151037498
he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when <unk> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend	2.761699813343848
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from <unk> infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied	2.6826957952797255
darcy after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing	2.7318984084548683
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire	3.2425732602169948
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself	2.9354102660922368
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground	2.053525026457146
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so	1.774109460982422
"could i expect it to be otherwise	2.4198437431766684
"yet why did he come	1.7352015332986075
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak	3.110688646536834
she enquired after his sister but could do no more	2.0969783677737848
"it is a long time mr bingley since you went away " said mrs bennet	2.392218416011727
he readily agreed to it	1.2804528719050237
"i began to be afraid you would never come back again	2.544317643138131
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away	2.443796140484184
miss lucas is married and settled	1.6450778947285194
and one of my own daughters	2.961372252874767
i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the <unk>	2.6956007214199733
it was in the times and the <unk> i know though it was not put in as it ought to be	3.656014827796858
it was only said <unk> george wickham <unk>	2.1231355221643344
to miss lydia bennet ' without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing	2.4703379959446603
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it	2.705326466753764
did you see it	1.5796866421562528
bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations	2.665285431092828
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	1.3161095406596601
how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell	2.7116313173678694
"it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married " continued her mother "but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me	2.4816289228368253
they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long	2.651656842306641
his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars	2.8081671519599856
elizabeth who knew this to be <unk> at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat	3.5489820355768167
it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present	2.7856866222654073
a few weeks he believed	1.8543619406536611
were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	2.6377833237603006
at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion	2.622135785304621
their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this	2.310968847082639
let me never see either one or the other again	2.1478573125121034
when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention	2.901116234034302
he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so <unk>	3.0159896354327222
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	3.0576613502141687
but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent	3.0079885451583293
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was <unk> of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time	3.162277660168379
"you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley " she added "for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned	2.6826957952797255
i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement	3.200320853929366
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business	2.387584875406889
they then went away	1.0992766140868628
as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <unk> them more	2.694348298255181
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	2.096698777047093
if he fears me why come hither	1.6438623128421086
if he no longer cares for me why silent	1.9398960439791215
i will think no more about him	2.00088977463701
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth	2.7901517475007815
"now " said she "that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy	2.6280938700483096
i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming	2.725591806369465
i am glad he <unk> here on tuesday	2.1245650357981685
it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance	2.2563865038251665
"yes very indifferent indeed " said elizabeth laughingly	1.9654261254733039
"my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now	3.105985605006923
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour's visit had revived	2.4244620170823286
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as <unk> were in very good time	3.046989570903508
when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister	2.7484780749649
her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas <unk> to invite him to sit by herself	2.3082384022886275
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided	2.464741749300338
he placed himself by her	1.302844861685453
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend	2.1152892578981257
though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour	2.2346170352669907
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour	2.7057017557522576
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage	2.3456059475075164
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did	2.848035868435802
her mother's <unk> made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family	2.154434690031884
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <unk> them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance	2.232735148777284
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was <unk> and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil	2.7878618460890134
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend	2.734914710313316
the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas	2.8745781759487943
the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth <unk> out the coffee in so close a <unk> that there was not a single <unk> near her which would admit of a chair	2.4244620170823286
and on the gentlemen's approaching one of the girls moved <unk> to her than ever and said in a whisper "the men shan't come and part us i am determined	3.162277660168379
we want none of them do we	1.8784345319570213
darcy had walked away to another part of the room	2.363818295346542
she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was <unk> against herself for being so silly	2.8250720843983217
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love	2.3122125933024096
is there one among the sex who would not <unk> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman	2.542820672564492
there is no indignity so <unk> to their feelings	3.1577470726697396
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee <unk> himself and she seized the opportunity of saying "is your sister at pemberley still	2.6895189853809103
"yes she will remain there till christmas	1.7737136822618433
"mrs annesley is with her	1.362920251298155
the others have been gone on to <unk> these three weeks	2.4747828556323226
he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again he walked away	2.673336939849399
when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a <unk> to her mother's <unk> for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	1.8139306939110624
she now lost every expectation of pleasure	1.6132966552744585
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as <unk> as herself	2.4816289228368253
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them	3.0011069565904434
"well girls " said she as soon as they were left to themselves "what say you to the day	2.722899394436915
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you	1.9251637135303061
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw	2.4044167678833763
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas's last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the <unk> were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three <unk> <unk> at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty	1.968419447286612
mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not	2.0884001149235574
and what do you think she said besides	1.9918736405853863
mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at <unk> she did indeed	2.6483213538363612
i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously	2.8538714513128958
mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	1.715437896342879
"the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other	1.996609697127835
i hope we may often meet again	1.8182605895607673
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it	2.7020209956687724
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection	2.519557774566429
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man	2.615209273124846
"you are very cruel " said her sister "you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment	2.79260952005277
"and how impossible in others	1.3868020053114503
forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante	2.737820478183027
a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone	2.4543995453920973
he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits	2.6917647512297775
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	2.6038679271393455
<unk> time you call " said she "i hope we shall be more lucky	2.8840586907908197
he should be particularly happy at any time c	2.40019057318779
and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them	2.4853369980495295
"can you come to morrow	1.5429021296994356
yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity	2.695264444405708
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed	3.078131845068321
in ran mrs bennet to her daughter's room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out "my dear jane make haste and hurry down	2.4025068658647646
he is come mr bingley is come	2.1904954218747643
here <unk> come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown	2.558667318911707
never mind miss lizzy's hair	1.3505957539994966
"we will be down as soon as we can " said jane "but i dare say kitty is <unk> than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago	2.942727176209282
what has she to do with it	1.981607118825884
come be quick be quick	1.4431976853362245
where is your <unk> my dear	1.975344706103208
but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters	2.923603857385409
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening	2.4466745863867216
after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument	2.4473800959524112
elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very <unk> said "what is the matter mamma	2.831669879521891
what do you keep winking at me for	2.4857999507040685
what am i to do	1.64588598676144
i did not wink at you	2.4747067057927374
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such <unk> and her intreaty that she would not give into it	2.7649967559715773
in a few minutes mrs bennet half opened the door and called out "lizzy my dear i want to speak with you	2.9636654298821288
elizabeth was forced to go	1.8421769040539187
"we may as well leave them by themselves you know " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall	3.2586822784666873
"kitty and i are going <unk> to sit in my dressing room	2.1586540589742595
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room	2.7441398643277095
mrs bennet's schemes for this day were <unk>	1.8894060956641734
bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter	2.3075704221683795
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged <unk> of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	2.232735148777284
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennet's means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	2.6826957952797255
after this day jane said no more of her indifference	2.4254610204803195
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time	2.6148764841241188
seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence	2.447747651526267
bingley was punctual to his <unk> and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on	3.245447902999281
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	2.381025756766841
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more <unk> and less <unk> than the other had ever seen him	2.7410002330236147
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs bennet's <unk> was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter	3.277431137851532
elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to <unk> her mother's schemes	2.3713737056616555
on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the <unk> as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all	2.053525026457146
their situation was awkward enough but her's she thought was still worse	2.0516560054401434
not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room	2.232735148777284
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	2.5865638909996185
i do not deserve it	3.183120354418008
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express	2.071638411350303
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane	2.248215946051109
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present	2.8256023127350636
"i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself	2.7109447006109306
he is gone to my father already	2.290480483516997
lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family	2.9064756457889587
how shall i bear so much happiness	1.867241989478295
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty	2.758377488500067
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation	2.5141044043190965
"and this " said she "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection	3.1224321406775646
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance	1.9981855020310768
"where is your sister	1.3651672288595833
"with my mother up stairs	1.4459660342187857
she will be down in a moment i dare say	2.706913005685233
he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister	2.726439528187961
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship	1.894618994407615
they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane's perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for <unk> the excellent understanding and <unk> excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself	1.566048452832833
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever	2.741787873140954
kitty <unk> and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon	2.205396384412006
mrs bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was	1.9952623149688797
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness	2.306668778320177
"you are a good girl " he replied "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled	3.04626751860278
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together	2.628398991671819
your <unk> are by no means unlike	2.3423635336306576
you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will <unk> you and so generous that you will always <unk> your income	2.879890003626585
"i hope not so	1.2240295595030848
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me	1.900458240901012
my dear mr bennet " cried his wife "what are you talking of	2.3136096076954167
why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more	1.502384070339812
then addressing her daughter "oh	1.5386848653263094
my dear dear jane i am so happy	2.009911512298057
i am sure i <unk> get a wink of sleep all night	2.4617615810595335
i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing	2.5666242083011683
i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together	3.1352891796443068
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen	1.8951419800379838
jane was beyond competition her favourite child	1.761796755399606
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <unk>	2.659961993047708
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some <unk> neighbour who could not be enough <unk> had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept	2.085205857248754
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur	2.154434690031884
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief	2.995180475468429
"he has made me so happy " said she one evening "by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring	3.1592055712656264
"i suspected as much " replied elizabeth	1.69406470155948
"but how did he account for it	1.6565530097659178
"it must have been his sister's doing	2.6837048319505725
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects	2.720714908194873
but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other	2.2758459260747883
"that is the most unforgiving speech " said elizabeth "that i ever heard you utter	2.997038544323376
it would <unk> me indeed to see you again the <unk> of miss bingley's pretended regard	3.6345081356585762
"would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again	2.848035868435802
"he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty	3.2407549258402795
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities	2.548892492789712
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and <unk> heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him	2.3713737056616555
"i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed	1.9720410094335366
lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all	2.1487583053016177
if i could but see you as happy	2.523735481114097
till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness	2.558297230817917
no no let me <unk> for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time	2.756719211169992
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton	2.9734132986753186
the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who <unk> it were familiar to them	2.8103642220934364
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered	2.553949132510177
it was lady catherine de bourgh	1.299431666510125
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt	2.4816289228368253
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word	2.6401428396326314
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance though no request of introduction had been made	2.6011778870632063
mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness	2.3404039925400077
after sitting for a moment in silence she said very <unk> to elizabeth "i hope you are well miss bennet	2.9100283958588893
that lady i suppose is your mother	2.114806107083159
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was	1.569286453283714
"and that i suppose is one of your sisters	2.388324441105845
"yes madam " said mrs bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine	2.8459257781602236
"she is my youngest girl but one	1.7736335689015605
my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family	2.670786742399152
"you have a very small park here " returned lady catherine after a short silence	2.256411831058136
"it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's	2.449452961351696
"this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full <unk> mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added "may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well	2.023589647725157
i saw them the night before <unk> elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	2.8705936129733023
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth "miss bennet there seemed to be a <unk> kind of a little <unk> on one side of your lawn	1.968419447286612
i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company	3.2590051450253896
"go my dear " cried her mother "and shew her ladyship about the different walks	2.310080390655115
i think she will be pleased with the <unk>	2.5216185208788
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs	2.2542526627749737
as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and <unk> them after a short <unk> to be decent looking rooms walked on	2.827562765259771
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it	2.706382778978124
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable	2.6872790788997754
"how could i ever think her like her nephew	2.076840116801813
said she as she looked in her face	2.3081242200461323
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner "you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither	2.8917531681210873
your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come	1.9552526320686794
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	1.417566694572053
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here	2.8949930118835527
"miss bennet " replied her ladyship in an angry tone "you ought to know that i am not to be <unk> with	3.374468851892797
but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so	2.3682026709654225
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it	2.6703864292889348
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago	2.348387137039044
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy	2.3713737056616555
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you	2.232735148777284
"if you believed it impossible to be true " said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain "i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far	2.8129534136822967
what could your ladyship propose by it	1.6647813668832148
"at once to insist upon having such a report universally <unk>	2.1039702586046864
"your coming to longbourn to see me and my family " said elizabeth coolly "will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence	2.927326711859563
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it	1.9491970781276822
has it not been <unk> <unk> by yourselves	2.280176951972758
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad	2.714294751327053
"i never heard that it was	1.7993020140963907
"i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship	2.291312639708126
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer	2.532590631562726
"this is not to be borne	2.681961215655231
has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage	1.9239642663904755
"your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	1.9774285493018382
"it ought to be so it must be so while he <unk> the use of his reason	3.132209079058035
but your arts and <unk> may in a moment of <unk> have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family	3.09791135623344
you may have drawn him in	1.8805168884499344
"if i have i shall be the last person to confess it	2.8925603013304464
"miss bennet do you know who i am	2.1228070909017003
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns	2.5561177480930257
"but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit	2.652303008296803
this match to which you have the presumption to <unk> can never take place	2.5749243127288204
now what have you to say	1.8720856042050926
"only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me	3.153128119820089
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied "the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind	2.632987958022977
from their infancy they have been intended for each other	1.989032551698951
it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of her's	3.0437446433685706
while in their <unk> we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly <unk> to the family	2.085205857248754
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends	2.304999324386772
to his <unk> engagement with miss de bourgh	1.7477128090354528
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy	2.0607949223997846
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin	2.266425316375874
"yes and i had heard it before	2.852365401369747
but what is that to me	1.913962937031119
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh	2.744576104582728
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage	2.3084761172485484
its <unk> depended on others	1.3802697404985158
if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice	2.809565054071133
"because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it	1.5063110126561998
yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all	2.3492639131458883
you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him	2.2974228048065113
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us	2.4057865084966124
"these are heavy misfortunes " replied elizabeth	1.4902136294839663
"but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine	2.8564252417404217
i am ashamed of you	1.3549397934892147
"let us sit down	1.0901467729359398
you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be <unk> from it	2.6898941629726507
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims	2.661635229798294
i have not been in the habit of <unk> disappointment	2.580238278873063
" that will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me	2.464508531244592

my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other	1.910973400612775
they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the father's from respectable honourable and <unk> though <unk> families	2.451261221841329
the <unk> pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune	2.498348406818824
is this to be endured	1.7114697396247298
but it must not shall not be	1.8040608867153232
if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up	2.8184372857079563
"in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere	2.370055588645386
he is a gentleman i am a gentleman's daughter so far we are equal	2.8417751955802903
you are a gentleman's daughter	1.7363781964596607

who are your uncles and <unk>	1.444862362262583
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition	2.195506390650471
"whatever my connections may be " said elizabeth "if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you	2.9914694209961494
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moment's deliberation "i am not	2.905059774388512
lady catherine seemed pleased	1.6894334183684494
"and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement	2.2365945760078088
"i will make no promise of the kind	1.931112280350882
"miss bennet i am shocked and astonished	1.807612566090698
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman	2.307041181610071
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever <unk>	2.515070509546664
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require	3.0394380621852326
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable	2.625581989625071
supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin	2.791401388131869
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged	2.7278526092167827
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine	2.483682360176044
"not so hasty if you please	1.5427659827336593
i have by no means done	2.1719906237407125
to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add	2.7735052981214285
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement	2.26715309095251
i know it all that the young man's marrying her was a <unk> up business at the expence of your father and uncles	3.2654374967561113
and is such a girl to be my nephew's sister	2.728822416789763
is her husband is the son of his late father's steward to be his brother	2.3335034342151415
of what are you thinking	1.6725209387233897
are the <unk> of pemberley to be thus <unk>	3.078122238770231
"you can now have nothing farther to say " she resentfully answered	2.158157191994713
"you have <unk> me in every possible method	2.6312278604324195
i must beg to return to the house	1.9664622417275726
and she rose as she spoke	1.6666793774835338
lady catherine rose also and they turned back	1.8581528887261516
her ladyship was highly incensed	1.6430168558487017
"you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew	2.5812653608018272
do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody	2.8845404526412066
you know my sentiments	1.5872570291084422
"you are then resolved to have him	1.7317771171268774
"i have said no such thing	1.7825955566669527
i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion <unk> my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me	2.7328393411362564
you refuse then to oblige me	1.5961773601203761
you refuse to <unk> the claims of duty honour and gratitude	2.6515459734370648
<unk> duty nor honour nor gratitude " replied elizabeth "have any possible claim on me in the present instance	2.6986430700555832
no principle of either would be <unk> by my marriage with mr darcy	2.5901185772778743
and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <unk>	2.085205857248754
this is your <unk> resolve	1.83856233872694
i shall now know how to act	2.110917009323276
do not imagine miss bennet that your <unk> will ever be gratified	2.9330506243640997
i came to try you	1.86308067105396
i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point	2.318128555389397
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added "i take no leave of you miss bennet	2.757346083627119
i send no compliments to your mother	1.7829185905626868
you deserve no such attention	1.5210629187259486
i am most seriously displeased	1.5890587223481532
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself	2.8039117826838194
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs	2.0478925518299134
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself	2.469558989677355
"she did not choose it " said her daughter "she would go	2.723379461816679
"she is a very fine looking woman	2.5328357615904404
and her calling here was prodigiously civil	1.678832134645599
for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well	2.3000948015273934
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you	2.691902008110282
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy	2.4525361740827774
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible	2.6032546460385255
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly	2.83399355459958
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy	2.4371441217884184
but from what the report of their engagement could <unk> elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea	1.8529220216409523
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together	3.1014384265707844
and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time	2.192345972483447
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce	2.1187853261287715
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the <unk> of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his <unk> side	1.6618362775387496
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and <unk> <unk>	2.4851526947121108
if he had been <unk> before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity <unk> could make him	2.154434690031884
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way	2.7856997303380235
"if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days " she added "i shall know how to understand it	2.848444636566117
i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his <unk>	2.175794751816754
if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all	2.7127912298935124
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they <unk> satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had <unk> mrs bennet's curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	2.154434690031884
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	3.1909580476019794
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held	2.942727176209282
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with <unk> all the <unk> explanations	3.1679825878424666
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down	2.760738246430153
as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents	2.175251045575322
i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony	2.9707109336175006
let me congratulate you on a very important <unk> the colour now <unk> into elizabeth's cheeks in the <unk> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was <unk> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued "you look conscious	1.701254279852589
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your <unk> to discover the name of your admirer	2.9152143874555225
this letter is from mr collins	1.7256832605368837
and what can he have to say	1.8179395962417997
<unk> very much to the purpose of course	2.429502981521926
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured <unk> lucases	2.7655680116230323
i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point	2.5155734398767824
<unk> thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been <unk> by the same authority	2.4816289228368253
your daughter elizabeth it is <unk> will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most <unk> <unk> in this <unk>	2.192345972483447
"can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this	1.831813931869975
"this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble <unk> and extensive patronage	2.255312229248495
yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may <unk> by a precipitate <unk> with this gentleman's proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of	2.321954250288982
but now it comes out	1.5898533711937566
" mr darcy you see is the man	2.1972947949574455
now lizzy i think i have surprised you	2.183636991108929
could he or the lucases have <unk> on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the <unk> more effectually to what they related	2.791718945275022
mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a <unk> and who probably never looked at you in his life	3.0925683614358954
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile	2.46917440657155
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her	2.042121387314836
<unk> mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she <unk> so disgraceful a match	1.8329807108324359
i thought it my duty to give the <unk> intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	2.2758459260747883
"mr collins moreover adds " "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad business has been so well <unk> up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known	2.4244620170823286
i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from <unk> my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married	2.5914827544107264
it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it	2.5348933233891335
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing	2.4740717197063518
" that is his notion of christian forgiveness	1.9643671482722573
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's situation and his expectation of a young olive branch	3.0719384781798826
you are not going to be <unk> i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report	2.900766012418922
for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn	2.467400402136632
cried elizabeth "i am excessively diverted	1.9023262269219028
but it is so strange	2.594261722436532
"yes that is what makes it amusing	2.022008456218047
nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and <unk> of my son in law	2.931523598127801
and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report	1.921675418210349
did she call to refuse her consent	1.6377056043450422
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it	3.045228832472775
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not	3.1018908028411354
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried	2.2173392723590104
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit	2.4816289228368253
the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out	2.3713737056616555
it was agreed to	1.2270385251080334
mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together	2.8953069834205754
bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to <unk> them	2.4639028351280925
they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other	2.1015320681011715
they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went <unk> on with him alone	2.6826957952797255
now was the moment for her resolution to be <unk> and while her courage was high she immediately said "mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your's	2.085205857248754
i can no longer help thanking you for your <unk> kindness to my poor sister	2.2306091764695797
ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it	3.127482385659619
were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express	3.032329475584925
"i am sorry exceedingly sorry " replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion "that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness	2.859693835374892
i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted	3.545342062854687
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars	3.173772489350341
"if you will thank me " he replied "let it be for yourself alone	2.4868929108043942
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other <unk> which led me on i shall not attempt to deny	3.1610217107395124
but your family owe me nothing	1.6024975964934822
much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you	2.685200623079904
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word	2.334140583794235
after a short pause her companion added "you are too generous to trifle with me	2.492489853692954
if your feelings are still what they were last <unk> tell me so at once	2.619102682044429
my affections and wishes are <unk> but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever	2.7616039957209364
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very <unk> gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances	1.8529220216409523
the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	2.4816289228368253
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight <unk> over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in <unk> of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable	1.8139306939110624
they walked on without knowing in what direction	2.128371093029663
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling <unk> on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship's apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give	1.4806572771858608
but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly <unk>	2.130727972939383
"it taught me to hope " said he "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before	2.7581032249530804
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely <unk> decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine <unk> and openly	2.9202756497245055
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied "yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that	2.483826881138158
after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations	2.609975556481296
"what did you say of me that i did not deserve	3.032574039507636
for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken <unk> my behaviour to you at the time had merited the <unk> reproof	2.4075282619482934
"the conduct of neither if <unk> examined will be <unk> but since then we have both i hope improved in civility	2.726412335626701
"i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself	2.3898975146940122
your reproof so well applied i shall never forget <unk> you behaved in a more gentleman like manner	1.8575764058061386
those were your words	1.305570507234668
you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have <unk> me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice	2.994976617707855
"i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression	2.4292038969131435
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way	2.9560900412144524
"i can easily believe it	1.4524939862855968
you thought me then <unk> of every proper feeling i am sure you did	2.7788061340747823
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me	2.71713636535599
do not repeat what i then said	1.7257705889218813
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it	2.4500780192083824
darcy mentioned his letter	1.2996779139792727
"did it " said he "did it soon make you think better of me	2.596016991865897
did you on reading it give any credit to its contents	2.127859209590541
she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed	2.496628179009793
"i knew " said he "that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary	2.913239462069319
i hope you have destroyed the letter	2.787511779029999
there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again	2.610760269689726
"the letter shall certainly be <unk> if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <unk> they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that <unk>	2.2758459260747883
the adieu is <unk> itself	1.5334745704311488
but think no more of the letter	1.8243429353700535
the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten	2.848035868435802
"i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind	2.0481791436928987
painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be <unk>	1.9723068058885869
i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle	2.8692253741255844
as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper	2.463188428978936
i was given good <unk> but left to follow them in pride and conceit	2.387037421972527
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was <unk> and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and <unk> to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own	1.5947870582948211
such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest <unk> elizabeth	2.430243106233748
what do i not owe you	1.782223715530174
you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous	2.317731545812449
by you i was properly humbled	2.041987774438327
i came to you without a doubt of my reception	2.459772665295351
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	2.258958293212062
<unk> you then persuaded yourself that i should	1.8533823718379256
what will you think of my vanity	2.0820050206193668
i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses	2.1642688497630935
"my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you	2.352296055196455
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong	2.084062925850351
how you must have hated me after that evening	2.3134710956651423
i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction	2.47651274947308
"i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley	2.3932489492872113
you <unk> me for coming	1.687873527836804
"no indeed i felt nothing but surprise	2.0812570437344426
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due	2.6917190221070992
"my object then " replied darcy "was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to	1.9952623149688797
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you	2.804741912064454
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend	1.6265507027536246
after walking several miles in a <unk> manner and too <unk> to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their <unk> that it was time to be at home	2.848035868435802
"what could become of mr bingley and jane	1.8575225314430688
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs	1.8349671791754012
darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it	2.6141365699225108
"i must ask whether you were surprised	1.832110374838648
when i went away i felt that it would soon happen	2.755387873693335
"that is to say you had given your permission	2.466931023196342
i guessed as much	1.2163319414317841
and though he exclaimed at the <unk> she found that it had been pretty much the case	3.6803375670568985
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent	2.349855897769746
his surprise was great	1.3364743864362763
he had never had the slightest suspicion	2.5387394531176892
i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <unk> i felt no doubt of their happiness together	2.232735148777284
"did you speak from your own observation " said she "when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring	2.8623291859459785
"and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him	2.3414155094555213
bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy	2.4959198589556832
i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him	2.4874824199155827
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him	3.242559322403033
but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments	2.695977860251341
he has heartily <unk> me now	1.6268904162323403
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself	2.8950554182002146
in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house	2.9749189520195034
"my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to	2.8783868950309803
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge	2.7804815874079916
the evening passed quietly <unk> by any thing extraordinary	2.320593016870859
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the <unk> were silent	2.1879560190938867
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <unk> in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her	2.3713737056616555
at night she opened her heart to jane	2.183749399030107
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet's general habits she was absolutely incredulous here	2.298094245019987
engaged to mr darcy	1.1989793970703526
no no you shall not deceive me	2.0012437797974005
i know it to be impossible	1.884737724787683
"this is a wretched beginning indeed	2.032734849539547
my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not	2.655760457744497
yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth	2.7439100015515288
he still loves me and we are engaged	1.9080689013339098
jane looked at her <unk>	2.044639244706836
i know how much you dislike him	2.007673583508707
"you know nothing of the matter	1.7921799604071154
that is all to be forgot	2.312133412149249
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now	2.9922611988636683
but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable	2.113181148044777
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself	2.549546829815945
miss bennet still looked all amazement	1.5943189150511834
elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth	2.4336605645739033
can it be really so	1.8413711753760502
yet now i must believe you " cried jane	2.1415867031657148
"my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain	2.5522975748448906
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him	2.4424841539478366
"there can be no doubt of that	2.5209818997923414
it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world	2.7963354717165494
but are you pleased jane	1.836926350796101
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight	1.8525812822569114
and do you really love him quite well enough	2.288826477253231
do any thing rather than marry without affection	2.137355286461775
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all	2.8349357858184416
"what do you mean	1.1262512209262054
"why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley	2.539287370151855
i am afraid you will be angry	2.635764109127612
"my dearest sister now be be serious	1.735525602337471
i want to talk very seriously	2.0902747160354784
let me know every thing that i am to know without delay	3.0217335539685957
"it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began	2.5281639964845875
another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment	2.53622324380064
were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley's friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me	2.761699813343848
but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me	2.7261083937714856
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton	2.543438872449534
i owe all that i know of it to another not to you	3.0778896494293826
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	2.0496288511061502
she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend	3.119993147728174
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia's marriage	2.3329503205694584
cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morning "if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley	3.0276388335784175
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here	2.6144503056652755
i had no notion but he would go a <unk> or something or other and not <unk> us with his company	3.1464271453802657
what shall we do with him	1.7826399421993524
lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley's way	2.7192956577975913
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <unk>	2.3995101968818027
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud "mr bennet have you no more <unk> <unk> in which lizzy may lose her way again to day	2.023589647725157
"it may do very well for the others " replied mr bingley "but i am sure it will be too much for kitty	3.3700579084292066
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home	2.8236745581505436
as she went up stairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her saying "i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself	2.6470640528283726
but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane's sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then	3.1317232438070883
during their walk it was resolved that mr bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening	2.2198927949254026
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's	2.1243690146811725
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	2.651404503537488
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme	2.9457596977042715
she did not fear her father's opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be <unk> him with fears and regrets in <unk> of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile	1.6050163175336876
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper "go to your father he wants you in the library	2.6826957952797255
she was gone directly	1.6050469104782563
her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious	2.0840990004696662
"lizzy " said he "what are you doing	2.9862858032506585
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate	2.2859041033283787
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy	2.6751672963590694
<unk> in other words you are determined to have him	2.0864882093965145
he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane	2.881584564387886
but will they make you happy	1.603629324855279
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him	2.90754003583141
indeed he has no improper pride	1.7231976921233672
he is perfectly amiable	1.1894717679049573
you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms	3.0718438525260385
"lizzy " said her father "i have given him my consent	2.8047655391268598
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him	2.86265478782445
but let me advise you to think better of it	2.189347103097377
i know your disposition lizzy	1.4802387961314223
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage	2.307708085990137
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery	1.6103554801927362
my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life	3.083660170924922
you know not what you are about	2.538735522651547
"well my dear " said he when she ceased speaking "i have no more to say	2.4366359101063395
if this be the case he deserves you	2.1771134290612952
i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy	3.043033106859724
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia	2.657191459413166
he heard her with astonishment	1.718493031273529
"this is an evening of wonders indeed	1.7960047968022936
and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the <unk> debts and got him his commission	2.5000103269675416
so much the better	1.087348981052116
it will save me a world of trouble and economy	1.9137775050914831
had it been your uncle's doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way	2.3345272396945425
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr collins's letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room "if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure	1.9429496147158305
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure	2.7992475308646285
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication	2.939254407256962
its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable	2.3155899848368113
nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general <unk> to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them	2.2758459260747883
she began at length to recover to <unk> about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself	2.470206524579055
who would have thought it	1.4314924982768351
and is it really true	1.6323220151916011
how rich and how great you will be	1.8522706442721788
what <unk> money what <unk> what carriages you will have	2.0530709667087454
jane's is nothing to it nothing at all	2.04923982585339
i am so pleased so happy	1.9974965601815744
such a charming man	1.280224745455706
a house in town	1.09826017024212
every thing that is charming	1.9357968647538082
ten thousand a year	1.0059009428365833
what will become of me	1.3662220540407608
i shall go distracted	1.2283964987751341
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away	2.5637322800580713
but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her	3.0200999862294173
"my dearest child " she cried "i can think of nothing else	2.137003000202245
ten thousand a year and very likely more	1.3573868366493753
<unk> as good as a lord	1.9382118606008911
and a special licence	1.1813529047740856
but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow	3.0153070641362465
this was a sad <unk> of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations' consent there was still something to be wished for	2.232735148777284
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion	1.9952623149688797
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	3.162277660168379
"i admire all my three sons in law highly " said he	2.0862247398215144
"how could you begin	1.3373210883113338
"i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place	2.357460985406401
"i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation	2.273962180495559
it is too long ago	1.5552308834538406
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun	3.4165511370834163
"my beauty you had early <unk> and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not	2.4816289228368253
now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence	2.0759200993115248
"for the liveliness of your mind i did	1.7614858548386847
"you may as well call it impertinence at once	2.0436932601813997
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention	2.445825942228931
i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them	2.2499757616163736
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so <unk> courted you	2.154434690031884
there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable	2.75431238808186
to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love	2.5020405742238987
"was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield	2.3412211408382313
who could have done less for her	2.0967467044432158
but make a virtue of it by all means	2.013209670468729
my good qualities are under your protection and you are to <unk> them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here	1.6050163175336876
"because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement	2.162314975013163
"but i was embarrassed	1.4095681903656485
"and so was i	1.2282440331612026
"a man who had felt less might	2.175666491955357
"how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it	3.1289807479683907
but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself	2.8056458236934576
i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you	2.887791402514223
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect	2.153649278850297
too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort <unk> from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject	2.719547738981046
this will never do	1.38933905299524
"you need not distress yourself	1.8154099125500889
the moral will be perfectly fair	1.654359861189391
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	2.654772639524478
my aunt's intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing	2.587945175199962
"lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use	2.6102405999651195
but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for	2.4166978600438855
"my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me	2.8545078236577135
my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made	2.6826957952797255
"shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to <unk> her	2.6404601059767225
"i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth	1.911109937727331
"and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did	2.7980434181137728
but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected	2.812607219263096
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner's long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows "i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory <unk> of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write	1.4384498882876628
but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err	2.543345761304649
you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes	2.4635088372014677
your idea of the ponies is delightful	2.219296278160779
we will go round the park every day	1.968384624478232
i am the happiest creature in the world	1.5620490709594181
perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice	2.5106827827048224
i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh	2.068863531275857
mr darcy <unk> you all the love in the world that he can spare from me	2.945010731580169
mr darcy's letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in reply to his last "dear sir "i must trouble you once more for congratulations	2.4244620170823286
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy	1.6682949524074973
console lady catherine as well as you can	2.7090873006517455
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew	2.5563920004493683
he has more to give	1.5129910005606153
miss bingley's congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere	2.694989030561653
she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard	2.652314367371729
jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved	2.9204928768868488
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother's in sending it	2.2476644140959157
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident	2.166851590857463
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was <unk> over	2.733134222353281
at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the <unk> and <unk> civility of her husband	2.1187853261287715
he bore it however with admirable calmness	2.0476953385270007
he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <unk> of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st james's with very decent composure	2.543345761304649
if he did <unk> his <unk> it was not till sir william was out of sight	3.3542082597203127
mrs philips's <unk> was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar	2.053525026457146
elizabeth did all she could to <unk> him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley	1.4330125702369627
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters	2.4790012497728147
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed	2.206681267792135
i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have <unk> domestic felicity in so <unk> a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly	1.566048452832833
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do	2.4037480146299606
he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected	2.2980470483832836
so near a <unk> to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart	2.9152029772818135
the <unk> wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other	2.4816289228368253
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters	2.5360630486396314
in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great	2.460160894322925
she was not of so <unk> a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia's example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less <unk>	2.6925166012253015
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going	2.2758459260747883
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet's being quite unable to sit alone	2.839287827521604
mary was obliged to <unk> more with the world but she could still <unk> over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by <unk> between her sisters' beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she <unk> to the change without much <unk>	2.023589647725157
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <unk> and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune	2.085205857248754
the <unk> letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished	2.7982788012146314
it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us	3.376887317819568
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help	3.112523311969262
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	2.5191150668424176
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them	2.737892751284973
their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme	2.4073022535444415
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a <unk> situation and always spending more than they ought	2.8022616738388284
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her's lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her	2.591048242169891
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth's sake he assisted him farther in his profession	2.3912748333588696
lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or <unk> and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley's good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone	1.9187520990478337
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage but as she thought it advisable to <unk> the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as <unk> and paid off every <unk> of civility to elizabeth	1.9952623149688797
pemberley was now georgiana's home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see	2.5730037736732077
they were able to love each other even as well as they intended	2.5114670287606935
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively <unk> manner of talking to her brother	2.69501686683783
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <unk> with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	2.6698797259366414
but at length by elizabeth's persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that <unk> which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	1.474142020110622
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms	2.2673096618170527
darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of <unk> them	2.7455732199623286
