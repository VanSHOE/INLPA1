it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	2.9306810762181277
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the <unk> property of some one or other of their daughters	2.053525026457146
"my dear mr bennet " said his lady to him one day "have you heard that netherfield park is let at last	2.4151934653713427
"but it is " returned she "for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it	2.7595324846221976
mr bennet made no answer	1.0413693791384213
"do not you want to know who has taken it	2.57754177406515
cried his wife impatiently	1.9444392218002284
" you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it	2.954777194286277
"why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr <unk> immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week	1.5483652565854986
"what is his name	1.3623781123782788
"is he married or single	1.251142433252523
single my dear to be sure	1.97631844452139
a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year	1.6315353994061865
what a fine thing for our girls	1.8830906558161182
how can it affect them	1.4896205167260996
"my dear mr bennet " replied his wife "how can you be so tiresome	2.0832817720213903
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them	2.8538645263178544
"is that his design in settling here	1.821904456845278
nonsense how can you talk so	1.595922741473769
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes	3.775053205324394
you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the party	2.4244620170823286
"my dear you flatter me	1.5014313695741763
i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now	2.9368256026432427
"in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of	2.2464468994063664
"but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood	2.840152872834741
"it is more than i engage for i assure you	2.22492583012044
"but consider your daughters	1.3055493510815146
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them	2.7263986084202556
"you are over <unk> surely	1.4909873569370942
i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy	1.9952623149688797
"i desire you will do no such thing	2.046896820361691
lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia	3.004070002165505
but you are always giving her the preference	2.155817886688311
"they have none of them much to recommend them " replied he "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters	2.6016798821677587
"mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way	2.2935866259655446
you take delight in <unk> me	1.7259862452761883
"you mistake me my dear	1.2468273444628752
i have a high respect for your nerves	2.36477860359547
they are my old friends	1.3842516748757474
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at <unk> "ah	2.2311720795207717
you do not know what i suffer	2.6595778732919544
"but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	2.586885262084018
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts <unk> humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	2.5931724389467177
her mind was less difficult to <unk>	2.0241216054527875
she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper	2.5614725787927077
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous	2.2113258043587356
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its <unk> was visiting and news	2.6848475123611277
he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it	2.6826957952797255
it was then <unk> in the following manner	2.8465445890504952
observing his second daughter employed in <unk> a hat he suddenly addressed her with "i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy	2.6295393234237983
"we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes " said her mother resentfully "since we are not to visit	3.22830731459419
"i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing	2.709475172220086
she has two nieces of her own	1.7491762393863668
she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her	2.852366125382978
"no more have i " said mr bennet "and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her <unk> you	2.9906240849060124
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters	2.4630063339985666
"don't keep <unk> so kitty for heaven's sake	1.7411220049006029
have a little compassion on my nerves	2.149363211505745
"kitty has no discretion in her <unk> " said her father "she times them ill	2.8429606372173692
"i do not cough for my own amusement " replied kitty fretfully	3.3627988644406317
"aye so it is " cried her mother "and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself	2.610157215682537
"then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her	3.142093647365335
<unk> mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing	3.235375959944856
"i honour your circumspection	1.2293086001608042
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little	1.7284025803117364
but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself	2.232735148777284
mrs bennet said only <unk> nonsense	1.6043283743464842
"what can be the meaning of that <unk> exclamation	2.7063088169952985
"do you consider the forms of introduction and the <unk> that is laid on them as nonsense	2.7999161168389226
i cannot quite agree with you there	1.7208902145794163
what say you mary	1.3826662262183531
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts	2.8671389460580556
"while mary is <unk> her ideas " he continued "let us return to mr bingley	2.4110909656675843
"i am sick of mr bingley " cried his wife	2.43113920683696
"i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before	2.798084249080765
if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him	2.935078231902617
it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now	2.954725056733244
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps <unk> the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while	2.321954250288982
"how good it was in you my dear mr bennet	2.4385205389504683
but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance	2.6443626044017923
well how pleased i am	1.3415667301512113
and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now	3.064142241914165
"what an excellent father you have girls " said she when the door was shut	2.7645444764020266
"i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter	2.842645550481414
at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing	2.9787940761542275
lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball	2.7308947987509598
said lydia <unk> "i am not afraid for though i am the youngest <unk> the <unk> the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet's visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner	2.2758459260747883
not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley	2.7157547304027037
they <unk> him in various ways with <unk> questions ingenious <unk> and distant <unk> but he <unk> the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	2.4244620170823286
her report was highly favourable	1.4823773722599736
sir william had been delighted with him	1.6173959651694922
he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to <unk> the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party	3.0459848441570054
nothing could be more delightful	2.337593274442005
"if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield " said mrs bennet to her husband "and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for	2.761699813343848
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet's visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library	2.82355735959248
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father	2.814234393992508
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of <unk> from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a <unk> horse	2.562657050610722
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all	2.3736561339191056
mrs bennet was quite disconcerted	2.3212669153469676
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be	2.154434690031884
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by <unk> the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	2.085205857248754
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were <unk> the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin	2.4816289228368253
and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man	2.5562686900460396
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman like he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners	2.6500782257015203
his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion	2.301315686450357
his brother in law mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble <unk> and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year	1.9429496147158305
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves	1.7742976608475267
what a contrast between him and his friend	2.290545767128313
mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party	2.3713737056616555
his character was decided	1.6620105314434213
he was the <unk> most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again	2.890890158593866
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters	2.4541097291305816
"come darcy " said he "i must have you dance	2.5580656119464367
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner	2.3477030895264512
"i certainly shall not	1.2467005435699399
you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner	2.3386445276855388
at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable	3.1709363560546566
"i would not be so fastidious as you are " cried bingley "for a kingdom	3.4686709521369576
" you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room " said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	2.9440565154417984
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld	2.285307600227109
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable	3.0674894165182747
"which do you mean	1.2583139945501942
and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till <unk> her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said "she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men	1.968419447286612
mr bingley followed his advice	1.4399258010446894
mr darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him	2.156984881298492
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family	1.9397252175752826
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party	2.8894324144492227
mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters	2.87559169629296
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a <unk> way	3.2821227857912167
elizabeth felt jane's pleasure	1.2254736138090891
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	2.232735148777284
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants	2.5692388944212614
they found mr bennet still up	1.7090970740274576
with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations	2.848035868435802
he had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	3.0520377215397057
my dear mr bennet " as she entered the room "we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball	2.4702415176393977
i wish you had been there	1.3284525740581503
jane was so admired nothing could be like it	2.049957300253433
every body said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice	2.355160196187903
first of all he asked miss lucas	1.8903758302684648
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance	2.4244620170823286
so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next	2.696020839800576
then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two <unk> with jane again and the two <unk> with lizzy and the <unk> " "if he had had any compassion for me " cried her husband impatiently "he would not have danced half so much	1.8957356524063758
for <unk> sake say no more of his partners	2.3394771244732695
that he had <unk> his <unk> in the first dance	4.360210014713154
my dear " continued mrs bennet "i am quite delighted with him	2.703692204765477
he is so excessively handsome	1.814633478440157
and his sisters are charming women	2.0533029771020996
mr bennet protested against any description of finery	1.67565635713983
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some <unk> the shocking rudeness of mr darcy	2.4407219021277378
"but i can assure you " she added "that lizzy does not lose much by not <unk> his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing	2.942727176209282
so high and so conceited that there was no <unk> him	2.309447240606197
he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great	2.1789665721389215
not handsome enough to dance with	1.19766019078702
i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set <unk>	2.7617498729237453
i quite detest the man	1.359131059628847
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him	3.1049663149350364
"he is just what a young man ought to be " said she <unk> good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners	3.134549736960448
so much ease with such perfect good breeding	1.8003353885476139
"he is also handsome " replied elizabeth "which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can	2.6447632057237818
his character is thereby complete	1.4448553640821802
"i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time	2.4726810157106733
i did for you	1.297401015359821
but that is one great difference between us	2.187302661614205
compliments always take you by surprise and me never	2.0417161664069767
what could be more natural than his asking you again	2.2928196857695404
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room	2.906602102223529
no thanks to his gallantry for that	1.8746920498207407
you are a great deal too <unk> you know to like people in general	3.16144971586856
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes	2.337945772085117
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	2.5075412403778348
"i would wish not to be hasty in <unk> any one but i always speak what i think	3.0776376946836606
"i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder	2.7853208824021953
with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others	2.5691028717905486
affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every where	1.822197522064977
but to be <unk> without <unk> or design to take the good of every body's character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone	3.046989570903508
and so you like this man's sisters too do you	1.8722525092011157
their manners are not equal to his	2.0353186119798607
"certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them	2.5299578913891905
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her	3.046334418093116
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less <unk> of temper than her sister and with a judgment too <unk> by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them	1.8957356524063758
they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited	2.879933672149496
they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply <unk> on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade	2.676813804451843
mr bingley <unk> property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it	2.4274261242087474
mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the <unk> of his days at netherfield and leave the next <unk> to purchase	1.7455628235338618
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a <unk> miss bingley was by no means unwilling to <unk> at his table nor was mrs hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her	1.7455628235338618
mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house	2.933709928630186
he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately	2.761699813343848
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character	3.121954467944206
bingley was <unk> to darcy by the easiness openness <unk> of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied	2.848035868435802
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion	2.43920355261004
in understanding darcy was the superior	1.7675400740280107
bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever	2.2341025283092066
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	2.3449271851664473
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence	2.212239880847427
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic	2.414256180662416
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful	1.9429496147158305
darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure	2.543345761304649
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much	2.3017673950127797
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of	2.543345761304649
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose	2.7986121435063875
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate	2.456480108957887
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	1.6731973634509107
for though <unk> by his rank it did not render him <unk> on the contrary he was all attention to every body	3.0163135058758344
by nature <unk> friendly and obliging his presentation at st james's had made him <unk>	1.989982881713107
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet	2.8736646802133654
they had several children	1.224374186436779
the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth's intimate friend	2.1511979331236093
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate	2.761699813343848
" you were mr bingley's first choice	1.8439352801147233
"yes but he seemed to like his second better	2.3305155150744103
you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice	1.854221259375321
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson	2.89931718780415
mr <unk> asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the <unk>	2.942727176209282
and his answering immediately to the last question oh	2.288442757419131
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point	2.244927902904859
" my <unk> were more to the purpose than yours eliza " said charlotte	2.540326697744968
"mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he	2.765035691319495
to be only just tolerable	1.50184434781279
"i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him	2.610157215682537
mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	2.502583088129155
"are you quite sure ma'am	1.5602045354237792
is not there a little mistake	1.7118617319266802
"i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her	1.9763351654036367
"miss bingley told me " said jane "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance	2.6884634463769825
with them he is remarkably agreeable	1.7156746087259298
"i do not believe a word of it my dear	2.63105847955294
but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a <unk> chaise	2.232735148777284
"i do not mind his not talking to mrs long " said miss lucas "but i wish he had danced with eliza	3.0258237107956023
<unk> time lizzy " said her mother "i would not dance with him if i were you	2.4535999050114894
"i believe ma'am i may safely promise you never to dance with him	1.968462208873467
"his pride " said miss lucas "does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it	2.7727870070364626
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself	2.8704324949465527
by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not <unk> a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary	1.9429496147158305
vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used <unk>	2.197952580567631
a person may be proud without being vain	1.8177898547716604
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us	2.346429872797684
i would keep a pack of <unk> and drink a bottle of wine every day	2.701672341610847
"then you would drink a great deal more than you ought " said mrs bennet "and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly	2.9141775285743727
the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit	2.8122905356003107
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield	2.318601800718804
the visit was returned in due form	2.019100041170419
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw <unk> in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration	1.4077153669117268
it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent	1.4440241885954521
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas	1.8134819089806518
"it may perhaps be pleasant " replied charlotte "to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded	3.046989570903508
if a woman <unk> her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark	2.4244620170823286
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself	2.888191188093556
we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement	2.456153396358663
in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels	2.1833868849726654
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on	2.5240208311398695
"but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow	2.712528793109147
if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too	3.146527584667994
"remember eliza that he does not know jane's disposition as you do	2.4427404558040324
"perhaps he must if he sees enough of her	1.9504916984916867
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention	2.5606813543673708
when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses	2.908062274522377
"your plan is a good one " replied elizabeth "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it	2.321954250288982
but these are not jane's feelings she is not acting by design	2.4224167288694742
as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its <unk>	2.7499504690389593
she has known him only a fortnight	1.8512230128916383
she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times	2.7076205412710403
"not as you represent it	1.5005838023126141
had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal	2.543345761304649
"yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like <unk> <unk> better than <unk> but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded	2.6826957952797255
"well " said charlotte "i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth	2.192345972483447
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance	1.9761293661886166
if the <unk> of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life	1.6744824380115346
"you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound	2.4568599784147125
you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself	3.2900489925691616
occupied in observing mr bingley's attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend	2.9720998113089667
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to <unk>	2.848035868435802
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	2.321954250288982
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	1.8083123882342198
of this she was perfectly <unk> to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with	3.162277660168379
he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others	3.101161135235022
his doing so drew her notice	1.5053195522521567
it was at sir william lucas's where a large party were assembled	2.2666036504655906
"what does mr darcy mean " said she to charlotte "by listening to my conversation with colonel forster	2.378627519873855
"that is a question which mr darcy only can answer	2.3902369743972214
he has a very <unk> eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him	3.0255116906812645
on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas <unk> her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said "did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton	1.6744824380115346
"with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady <unk>	2.8174619301632453
"you are severe on us	1.208107319069976
"i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows	2.428354694419301
"you are a very strange creature by way of a friend	2.295692593663475
always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body	2.223145167471948
if my vanity had taken a <unk> turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <unk>	2.4816289228368253
on miss lucas's <unk> however she added "very well if it must be so it <unk> and gravely glancing at mr darcy "there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with <unk> your breath to cool your <unk> ' and i shall keep mine to <unk> my song	1.8957356524063758
her performance was pleasing though by no means capital	2.207566148887319
after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display	1.8738174228603839
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a <unk> air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached	2.543345761304649
elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long <unk> was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and <unk> <unk> at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room	1.6744824380115346
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began	2.154434690031884
"what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy	1.981454890543217
there is nothing like dancing after all	2.13049514882923
"certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in <unk> amongst the less polished societies of the world	2.8591238980311107
every <unk> can dance	1.3537655366184418
sir william only smiled	1.2290012284104614
"your friend <unk> delightfully " he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group "and i doubt not that you are an <unk> in the <unk> yourself mr darcy	2.873452526429443
"you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir	1.9715985588238887
do you often dance at st james's	1.4871622475617214
"do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	2.947885391022426
"it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it	2.9041011671073016
"you have a house in town i conclude	2.217383095172807
"i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas	2.646615689879299
he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very <unk> thing and called out to her "my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing	1.9952623149688797
mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner	3.104537013337866
you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you	2.6398121115252717
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william "indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing	2.154434690031884
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner	2.5193177721550004
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain	2.5218381263479834
elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	2.259651869898013
"mr darcy is all politeness " said elizabeth smiling	3.190424092628654
"he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner	2.5738899141785745
elizabeth looked archly and turned away	1.3393830062323444
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley "i can guess the subject of your <unk>	2.942727176209282
"i should imagine not	1.2243075717540046
i was never more <unk>	1.5935346596203799
the <unk> and yet the noise the <unk> and yet the self importance of all these people	2.9222009453127193
what would i give to hear your <unk> on them	2.177374905026537
"your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you	1.54268662182409
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	2.9420597399456683
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of <unk> such reflections	2.5774606890531317
mr darcy replied with great <unk> "miss elizabeth bennet	2.0635141971647237
"i am all astonishment	1.2279000558551598
how long has she been such a favourite	2.0868925639562024
and pray when am i to wish you joy	1.9935002363958243
"that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask	2.520923684168057
you will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you	3.2207048962314904
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit <unk> long	2.7766532025077986
mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in <unk> of <unk> <unk> on a distant relation and their mother's fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his	2.023589647725157
her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds	2.2672703917170884
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a <unk> shop just over the way	2.154434690031884
at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters	2.610157215682537
their visits to mrs philips were now <unk> of the most interesting intelligence	3.4851557325683618
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves	2.768578672481951
they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingley's large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an <unk>	2.6072760510503445
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennet coolly observed "from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the <unk> girls in the country	2.610157215682537
i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced	2.554275235743639
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london	2.321954250288982
"i am astonished my dear " said mrs bennet "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly	3.006259598786067
if i wished to think <unk> of any body's children it should not be of my own however	2.899963127629992
"if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	2.3124700330768007
"yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever	2.9785599671555167
"this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree	2.619680482373074
i had hoped that our sentiments <unk> in every particular but i must so far <unk> from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish	2.9498674713835706
"my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother	3.238615105254042
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do	2.9501899090905024
<unk> " cried lydia "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss <unk> as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in <unk> library	2.4816289228368253
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the <unk> with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer	2.8315100260359873
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read "well jane who is it from	2.612290337969848
what does he say	1.0635753275334943
well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love	1.991416374142165
"it is from miss bingley " said jane and then read it aloud	2.8104639895090733
"my dear friend "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me we shall be in danger of <unk> each other for the rest of our lives for a whole day's tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel	2.023589647725157
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	2.6125565315498993
"i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that	2.111949817843069
<unk> out " said mrs bennet "that is very unlucky	2.1695734040355763
"can i have the carriage	2.0117270868244606
"no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night	2.8710201601881336
"that would be a good scheme " said elizabeth "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home	3.1848669000241854
"but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure	2.2531668628207253
"they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them	3.0097411060927928
"but if you have got them to day " said elizabeth "my mother's purpose will be answered	3.0012786801976556
she did at last <unk> from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged	2.453872965489213
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful <unk> of a bad day	3.1696377673839713
her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it <unk> hard	2.7233109434880856
said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	3.0682804199399456
till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance	3.5375651516621978
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth "my dearest lizzy "i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday	2.4816289228368253
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better	2.378894059871084
they insist also on my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a <unk> <unk> and head <unk> there is not much the matter with me	2.4244620170823286
"well my dear " said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud "if your daughter should have a <unk> fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders	2.053525026457146
people do not die of little trifling <unk>	1.8013566778342516
she will be taken good care of	2.231287801992033
i would go and see her if i could have the carriage	2.7874004816913938
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horse woman walking was her only alternative	3.1345764077675904
she declared her resolution	1.228663141226306
"how can you be so silly " cried her mother "as to think of such a thing in all this dirt	3.318222927589792
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there	3.152282760770644
"is this a hint to me lizzy " said her father "to send for the horses	2.3682697293133677
the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles	2.0069151352086636
i shall be back by dinner	2.3372832543256696
"i admire the activity of your benevolence " observed mary "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	2.5342891385272437
"we will go as far as meryton with you " said catherine and lydia	2.5693048117641597
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together	1.9567472073647618
in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' <unk> and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick <unk> <unk> over <unk> and springing over <unk> with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty <unk> and a face <unk> with the warmth of exercise	1.701254279852589
she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise	2.5288865381891608
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it	2.3713737056616555
she was received however very politely by them and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness	2.666950812855751
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the <unk> <unk> her coming so far alone	2.9931699616186185
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	2.6183241498162957
miss bennet had <unk> ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room	2.6939318228470803
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance	2.2758459260747883
she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little <unk> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	2.751504463074643
the apothecary came and having examined his <unk> said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts	2.2758459260747883
the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head <unk> acutely	2.1175543574407367
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere	2.7974641648733933
miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present	2.085205857248754
elizabeth most <unk> consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes	2.530483235334861
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner	2.260299089320355
to the civil enquiries which then <unk> in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley's she could not make a very favourable answer	2.942727176209282
jane was by no means better	2.077258208780041
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	1.7782794100389228
his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <unk> as she believed she was considered by the others	2.791520604081596
she had very little notice from any but him	1.9361703671319834
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an <unk> man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a <unk> had nothing to say to her	1.8957356524063758
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	2.9873070202483745
mrs hurst thought the same and added "she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker	2.5781429331825314
she really looked almost wild	1.3885530338912033
"she did indeed louisa	1.3034541588125705
i could hardly keep my countenance	1.9403838526841013
very nonsensical to come at all	1.5039774737053953
why must she be <unk> about the country because her sister had a cold	2.6218600410471256
"yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six <unk> deep in <unk> i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office	2.761699813343848
"your picture may be very exact louisa " said bingley "but this was all lost upon me	2.42865675712171
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning	2.4377260914218644
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice	1.5642771614219164
" you observed it mr darcy i am sure " said miss bingley "and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition	2.894153248851079
"to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone	2.2239368560870645
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum	2.4090428915212807
"it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing " said bingley	2.7721376213378606
"i am afraid mr darcy " observed miss bingley in a half whisper "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes	2.6342143009215238
"not at all " he replied "they were <unk> by the exercise	2.926821775649482
a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again	2.453370600443643
but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it	3.0322084313224296
"i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton	1.9644216863731774
"yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside	2.028046436453054
"that is capital " added her sister and they both laughed heartily	2.5990749489372824
"if they had uncles enough to <unk> all cheapside " cried bingley "it would not make them one <unk> less agreeable	2.730699919423003
"but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world " replied darcy	2.8174258712625697
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty <unk> and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations	2.4492827126188974
on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book	1.968419447286612
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment	2.229766848317478
"do you prefer reading to cards	1.487863831270315
"miss eliza bennet " said miss bingley <unk> cards	2.46249965577334
"i deserve neither such praise nor such censure " cried elizabeth "i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things	2.981564882493351
"in <unk> your sister i am sure you have pleasure " said bingley "and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	2.948071014564646
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were <unk>	2.6580326790993056
he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded	2.084171269994034
"and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into	2.761699813343848
"i am astonished " said miss bingley "that my father should have left so small a collection of books	2.6065811586827716
"it ought to be good " he replied "it has been the work of many generations	3.2837154309907652
"and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always <unk> books	2.6016445757700093
"i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these	2.1356124296979133
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place	2.605141336519574
charles when you <unk> your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley	2.6170475923959273
"i wish it may	1.1530812308705638
"but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model	2.5433635552567737
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire	2.291283107015316
"with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will <unk> it	2.3204410447597033
"i am talking of <unk> charles	1.70742675676211
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game	2.192345972483447
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring	1.8912704361812922
said miss bingley "will she be as tall as i am	2.4892372051908085
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height or rather <unk>	1.9372109872303207
"how i long to see her again	1.4597126519237933
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much	1.9229167862898768
such a countenance such manners	1.4820055076862149
and so extremely accomplished for her age	1.693038365261309
her performance on the piano forte is <unk>	1.8396489064846386
"it is amazing to me " said bingley "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are	3.107517554800347
"all young ladies accomplished	1.4014248932170847
my dear charles what do you mean	1.7713860262211385
"yes all of them i think	2.173049161003421
they all <unk> tables <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>	2.316845121218304
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished	2.761699813343848
"your list of the common extent of accomplishments " said darcy "has too much truth	2.4111137917107324
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general	2.780559569038071
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished	2.673999526351221
<unk> i i am sure " said miss bingley	1.7800954996703766
"then " observed elizabeth "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman	2.4658509838380813
"yes i do comprehend a great deal in it	2.084349724319706
certainly " cried his faithful <unk> "no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly <unk> what is usually met with	2.421138872112565
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern <unk> to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved	1.8957356524063758
"all this she must possess " added darcy "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading	2.822587076786127
"i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women	2.1019627203685376
i rather wonder now at your knowing any	1.7599838883381012
"are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this	2.451552301686337
" i never saw such a woman	1.706111142262313
i never saw such <unk> and taste and application and elegance as you describe united	2.5262487364136104
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	2.1187853261287715
as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room	2.2982450386121798
<unk> bennet " said miss bingley when the door was closed on her "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by <unk> their own and with many men i dare say it <unk>	2.321954250288982
but in my opinion it is a paltry <unk> a very mean art	2.898850073538295
"undoubtedly " replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed "there is <unk> in all the arts which ladies sometimes <unk> to employ for <unk>	2.5747439074991227
whatever bears affinity to <unk> is <unk>	1.740459274347571
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject	2.9149597942306635
bingley urged mr jones's being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most <unk> <unk>	2.4806205270356356
this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better	2.3713737056616555
they <unk> their wretchedness however by <unk> after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	2.4244620170823286
in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation	3.015950494939599
the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with	1.8743677931416587
mrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield	1.7615770326037883
she would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable	2.931955155763027
after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingley's appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour	2.4418970082537097
bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected	2.574653910908986
"indeed i have sir " was her answer	1.6617641280845328
"she is a great deal too ill to be moved	2.486716334251702
mr jones says we must not think of moving her	2.4026877525359684
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness	2.469666005835472
"it must not be thought of	2.122781666906539
my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal	2.9568315323186183
"you may depend upon it madam " said miss bingley with cold civility "that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us	2.544365540382645
mrs bennet was <unk> in her acknowledgments	2.420271400991409
"i am sure " she added "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and <unk> a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without <unk> the sweetest temper i ever met with	1.7615770326037883
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her	2.1557675126047666
you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk	2.498408942410659
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield	3.100837324578075
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short <unk>	3.241097765315575
"whatever i do is done in a hurry " replied he "and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes	2.596184008924869
at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here	1.9950248247877644
"that is exactly what i should have supposed of you " said elizabeth	2.6929376651928942
"you begin to comprehend me do you	1.8025012429247802
cried he turning towards her	1.212401977577645
yes i understand you perfectly	1.4968805259967142
"i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful	3.5537761591912145
"that is as it happens	1.6469735239231744
it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	2.470267136358888
"i did not know before " continued bingley immediately "that you were a <unk> of character	2.739446014743326
it must be an amusing study	2.6464822614674754
"yes but intricate characters are the most amusing	1.8088735757324432
they have at least that advantage	1.8933835052471508
"the country " said darcy "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study	2.5285774083602477
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and <unk> society	2.3205063545822022
"yes indeed " cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood	2.418135388646835
"i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town	2.673629364638688
every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away	2.995158857341935
mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete <unk> over him continued her triumph	2.47919500369581
the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley	2.107720603575028
"when i am in the country " he replied "i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same	3.403790201184527
"aye that is because you have the right disposition	2.483464240543531
but that gentleman " looking at darcy <unk> to think the country was nothing at all	2.4010898471838575
"indeed mama you are mistaken " said elizabeth <unk> for her mother	2.661295579002276
"you quite <unk> mr darcy	1.5696685458170483
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true	2.741913097520387
"certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few <unk> larger	2.7260226094280346
i know we dine with four and twenty families	1.9077600739288847
nothing but concern for elizabeth could <unk> bingley to keep his countenance	2.289910973214872
his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile	2.484275144091978
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away	2.9154499164969274
"yes she called yesterday with her father	1.7434274321692191
what an agreeable man sir william is mr bingley is not he	2.3257842647763707
so much the man of fashion	2.233808260350195
so genteel and so easy	1.5410712346690034
he has always something to say to every body	2.1503185910673337
that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter	2.2213586082148886
but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you	2.444078212501191
it is a pity they are not handsome	2.9714366674632577
not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend	2.6028063906903713
"she seems a very pleasant young woman " said bingley	2.033410116463206
dear yes but you must own she is very plain	2.625095172162197
i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking	3.2344796107389464
when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away	2.4816289228368253
but however he did not	1.1556151535419137
perhaps he thought her too young	1.807248433874147
"and so ended his affection " said elizabeth impatiently	2.568858852752191
"there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way	2.6793726415601
"i have been used to consider poetry as the <unk> of love " said darcy	3.756760767974221
"of a fine stout <unk> love it may	1.7691327534177383
every thing <unk> what is strong already	1.9444649578755566
but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good <unk> will <unk> it entirely away	2.8390746612651903
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for <unk> him also with lizzy	2.4244620170823286
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	2.1679383682013116
lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age	2.5539948072484697
she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	2.3713737056616555
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's <unk>	2.1140798834376473
"i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball	2.745022751374924
lydia declared herself satisfied	1.3369184254909348
yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again	2.8731084757713248
and when you have given your ball " she added "i shall insist on their giving one also	2.4582795585098425
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	2.4568855005408095
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley's <unk> on fine eyes	1.8329807108324359
the day passed much as the day before had done	2.7474159074319666
mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the <unk> who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room	2.848035868435802
the loo table however did not appear	1.8380870352889616
mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by <unk> to his sister	3.096505534861205
mr hurst and mr bingley were at <unk> and mrs hurst was observing their game	2.9409853008171685
elizabeth took up some <unk> and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion	2.6174511881670512
the <unk> <unk> of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in <unk> with her opinion of each	2.023589647725157
"how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter	2.310785380174411
"you write uncommonly <unk> "you are mistaken	1.7392268332050427
i write rather slowly	1.227216026285101
"how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year	2.315569235994196
letters of business too	1.3016514820735847
how odious i should think them	2.0738344322461515
"it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	2.1716293886191913
"pray tell your sister that i long to see her	1.7377867543442727
"i have already told her so once by your desire	2.04335124359576
"i am afraid you do not like your pen	2.718198364005135
i mend <unk> remarkably well	1.316165851062541
"thank you but i always mend my own	2.3782800637953425
"how can you contrive to write so even	2.226094252197077
"tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the <unk> and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss <unk>	2.2758459260747883
"will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again	2.041147434152999
at present i have not room to do them justice	3.0751618574771777
it is of no consequence	1.96794897478536
i shall see her in january	1.7733295525335775
"it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill	2.7243716105623785
"that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline " cried her brother "because he does not write with ease	2.8471047252747765
he studies too much for words of four <unk>	2.1716502600283887
do not you darcy	1.7962483683901296
"my style of writing is very different from yours	2.1067893712451435
cried miss bingley <unk> <unk> in the most careless way imaginable	3.2664177297928267
he leaves out half his words and <unk> the <unk> "my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <unk>	2.543345761304649
"your humility mr bingley " said elizabeth <unk> <unk> reproof	2.580484583104483
"nothing is more deceitful " said darcy "than the appearance of humility	3.151493147366883
it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect <unk> "and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty	2.459353275575355
"the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting	2.4816289228368253
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much <unk> by the possessor and often without any attention to the <unk> of the performance	3.277328476559504
when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very <unk> in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <unk> and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else	1.6876124757881479
"nay " cried bingley "this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning	2.780651168658001
"i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such <unk>	3.198364374446819
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were <unk> your horse a friend were to say <unk> you had better stay till next week ' you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month	1.8529220216409523
"you have only proved by this " cried elizabeth "that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition	2.8470073225793753
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself	2.3413181171799575
"would mr darcy then consider the <unk> of your original intention as <unk> for by your obstinacy in <unk> to it	2.8901288128649885
"upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself	2.4785130866477685
"you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged	2.8116683563108413
allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety	2.023589647725157
"to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you	2.377019620408508
"to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either	2.1169343765581075
"you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection	2.77284415600867
a regard for the <unk> would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it	2.504878423434548
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley	3.2506075801066583
we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance <unk> before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon	2.4790072581705798
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be <unk> into it	2.085205857248754
"will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to <unk> with rather more <unk> the degree of importance which is to <unk> to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties	2.4244620170823286
"by all means " cried bingley "let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of	2.5736448646118544
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference	3.1392981836234224
i declare i do not know a more <unk> object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do	2.574867789223638
mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh	2.8555755824188953
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an <unk> with her brother for talking such nonsense	2.8458874891887898
"i see your design bingley " said his friend	2.3005183447483444
arguments are too much like <unk>	1.827982236127041
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me	2.9649395301551684
mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	1.9187051515983227
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music	2.781999764630541
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly <unk> she seated herself	2.634464965103113
mrs hurst <unk> with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcy's eyes were fixed on her	2.4816289228368253
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange	2.6826957952797255
she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present	2.6826957952797255
after playing some <unk> <unk> miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her "do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to <unk> such an opportunity of dancing a reel	2.192345972483447
he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence	2.140642817792075
said she "i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply	2.935019657513084
you wanted me i know to say <unk> ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in <unk> those kind of schemes and <unk> a person of their <unk> contempt	2.543345761304649
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare	3.2705964889991415
"indeed i do not dare	2.743698253893405
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and <unk> in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so <unk> by any woman as he was by her	2.053525026457146
he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger	2.7654628433920534
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth	2.459351886142961
"i hope " said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day "you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can <unk> it do <unk> the younger girls of running after the officers	1.8529220216409523
and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady <unk>	2.441299392959955
do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley	2.484445520078354
put them next to your great uncle the judge	1.898155960123561
they are in the same profession you know only in different lines	2.543510124957397
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself	2.7323429450187366
"i did not know that you intended to walk " said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard	3.186571070729782
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself	2.594526642997574
the path just admitted three	1.377882571436461
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said "this walk is not wide enough for our party	2.2146155436762323
but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered "no no stay where you are	2.5050198313957557
the <unk> would be spoilt by <unk> a fourth	2.081643505241674
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	2.449301902895058
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	1.8139306939110624
they could describe an entertainment with <unk> relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit	2.2106743232214754
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object	2.8487947964017137
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps	2.908925818428959
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite <unk> mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was "very glad " but <unk> and warmth remained for bingley's salutation	2.761699813343848
he was full of joy and attention	1.6931998622606055
the first half hour was spent in <unk> up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door	2.2758459260747883
he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	2.531614683102837
elizabeth at work in the opposite <unk> saw it all with great delight	2.253572585215828
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain	2.547058453552462
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open <unk> rejected	2.525804277212051
she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her	3.1175297725564057
darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her <unk> and <unk> joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet	2.848035868435802
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcy's progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page	2.761699813343848
she could not <unk> him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on	3.029493653238711
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading	2.4539166647752766
how much sooner one <unk> of any thing than of a book	2.517067883484804
when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library	3.9359168318551365
no one made any reply	1.4513759557407078
she then <unk> again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said "by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield	1.968419447286612
i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure	2.3713737056616555
"if you mean darcy " cried her brother "he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards	2.1187853261287715
"i should like balls infinitely better " she replied "if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something <unk> <unk> in the usual <unk> of such a meeting	2.942727176209282
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day	2.1823457087446863
<unk> more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball	2.601723357979205
miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room	2.135922656745344
her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all <unk> was still <unk> <unk>	2.6413029961732275
in the <unk> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said "miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room	2.6826957952797255
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <unk>	2.698273916120517
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately	1.99158983631099
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked up	2.699054216152691
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book	2.5926299665589707
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their <unk> to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would <unk>	2.321954250288982
"what could he mean	1.382698446469022
"not at all " was her answer "but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our <unk> way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it	2.4857407082628478
"i have not the smallest objection to explaining them " said he as soon as she allowed him to speak	2.8325007916553844
"you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each <unk> confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your <unk> appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire	1.7301957388458942
"i never heard any thing so abominable	2.0059041797191126
how shall we punish him for such a speech	2.2654790504106432
"nothing so easy if you have but the inclination " said elizabeth	2.4281398390588786
"we can all plague and punish one another	1.669025129087595
teaze him laugh at him	1.4246325928949461
intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done	3.027593360673982
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind	1.6769433839173322
no no i feel he may defy us there	1.9871458093767105
and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject	2.7521748234461665
mr darcy may <unk> himself	1.7638171164298828
"mr darcy is not to be laughed at	2.789028083345261
"that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance	2.794446347127581
i dearly love a laugh	1.451950358656216
"miss bingley " said he "has given me credit for more than can be	2.7625347478153
the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke	2.78593098899107
"certainly " replied elizabeth "there are such people but i hope i am not one of them	3.1315806623702973
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good	2.0993804649621226
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do <unk> me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can	2.453398016350232
but these i suppose are <unk> what you are without	2.5138381333197346
"perhaps that is not possible for any one	2.0887939248562066
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those <unk> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule	2.712953481881267
<unk> as vanity and pride	1.2333827913473183
"yes vanity is a weakness indeed	1.6679450840196708
but pride where there is a real <unk> of mind pride will be always under good <unk>	2.7024618082155416
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	1.7969004113056313
"your examination of mr darcy is over i presume " said miss bingley "and pray what is the result	2.8855377909576507
"i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect	2.991544492689304
he owns it himself without disguise	1.5714046744691128
i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding	2.3212503879569537
my temper i dare not vouch for	2.0703470529302512
it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world	2.493311496297079
i cannot forget the follies and <unk> of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself	2.7574653737765846
my feelings are not <unk> about with every attempt to move them	2.2056423394655855
my temper would perhaps be called resentful	1.7477838038292715
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever	1.5977129891206585
but you have chosen your fault well	1.9622876680985866
i really cannot laugh at it	1.5385053818829317
"and your defect is a <unk> to hate every body	2.548575381697621
"and yours " he replied with a smile "is wilfully to misunderstand them	2.169792287730741
<unk> you will not mind my <unk> mr <unk> her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano forte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it	2.761699813343848
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention	2.37657805253946
but mrs bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish jane's week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before	2.6182807649806867
her answer therefore was not <unk> at least not to elizabeth's wishes for she was impatient to get home	2.9986312925422522
mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well	2.3713737056616555
against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves <unk> long she urged jane to borrow mr bingley's carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made	1.7615770326037883
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred	2.7016850571316966
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	2.9315480201089783
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right	2.053525026457146
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough	3.0951553280236554
she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself	3.0911813920249958
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could <unk> her with the hope of <unk> his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <unk> it	1.9429496147158305
steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he <unk> most <unk> to his book and would not even look at her	2.192345972483447
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place	2.0256272046910686
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former	1.9187520990478337
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits	2.529101151187812
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	2.225041628816834
but their father though very <unk> in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle	3.054062870185629
the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth	2.570342706930918
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough <unk> and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bare <unk> to listen to	2.2625048839780915
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort	2.5571784681632925
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been <unk> and it had actually been <unk> that colonel forster was going to be married	2.154434690031884
"i hope my dear " said mr bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning "that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party	2.3713737056616555
"who do you mean my dear	2.0597253912074467
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her	3.0045404582751094
i do not believe she often sees such at home	2.7067900475092994
"the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger	2.647555584497167
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled	1.0374103423000596
it is mr bingley i am sure	1.8069194981858872
why jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing	2.4107668441912162
well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley	2.8839619062813266
there is not a bit of fish to be got to day	2.0913196174132347
lydia my love ring the bell	1.5795768309133857
i must speak to hill this moment	1.8632178440247475
"it is not mr bingley " said her husband "it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life	3.3939876989525484
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	2.4936562169252814
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained	2.100103752564288
"about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention	2.6250592590648907
it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	2.9672572412161284
my dear " cried his wife "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned	2.5123305239523677
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	2.867567501796048
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to <unk> bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	1.968419447286612
"it certainly is a most <unk> affair " said mr bennet "and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn	2.5138791397236604
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself	2.940023251099769
"no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical	3.775053205324394
"why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear	2.62966529561235
hunsford near <unk> kent th <unk>	1.465573977758668
dear sir the <unk> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to <unk> the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem <unk> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at <unk>	1.566048452832833
my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received <unk> at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose <unk> and <unk> has preferred me to the valuable <unk> of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <unk> myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those <unk> and <unk> which are <unk> by the church of england	1.4677992676220695
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of <unk> your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter	2.321954250288982
i remain dear sir with <unk> compliments to your lady and daughters your well <unk> and friend william collins	2.406001038036823
"at four o'clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman " said mr bennet as he <unk> up the letter	2.5411606743353903
"he seems to be a most <unk> and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so <unk> as to let him come to us again	2.4244620170823286
"there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him	2.9961927183179022
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of <unk> marrying and <unk> his <unk> whenever it were required	2.8171018724069414
"he must be an <unk> i think " said she	2.3485421088045544
"i cannot make him out	1.5648454747304026
there is something very pompous in his style	2.1069927097176833
we cannot suppose he would help it if he could	2.089674234031545
can he be a sensible man sir	1.9530380633053397
"no my dear i think not	2.4683816366054234
i have great hopes of finding him quite the <unk>	2.1054661565866786
there is a mixture of <unk> and self importance in his letter which promises well	3.3265675140229947
i am impatient to see him	1.523301011358327
"in point of <unk> " said mary "his letter does not seem defective	2.5670458218218606
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed	2.8485122104472596
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting	2.422641662490996
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	2.6826957952797255
as for their mother mr collins's letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters	2.848035868435802
mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family	2.8998572908110347
mr bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself	2.883662785793799
he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty	2.4456986468350004
his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal	2.226487722813016
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance <unk> had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	1.8139306939110624
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his <unk> but mrs bennet who <unk> with no compliments answered most readily "you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be <unk> enough	1.9952623149688797
things are settled so <unk>	1.3675402864885673
"you <unk> perhaps to the entail of this estate	2.1901255579368666
sir i do indeed	1.4082143792447768
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess	2.99342025082033
not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world	2.7061974903981163
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed	2.5139868853057474
"i am very sensible madam of the <unk> to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate	3.290344562312668
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them	2.9042552846300302
at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted " he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other	2.8877537714496646
they were not the only objects of mr collins's admiration	3.094347632466979
the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet's heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property	2.3713737056616555
but here he was set right by mrs bennet who assured him with some <unk> that they were very well able to keep a good <unk> and that her daughters had nothing to do in the <unk>	2.543345761304649
he begged pardon for having displeased her	1.662596486192811
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour	2.1955330673819144
lady catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable	2.6775260369102556
mr bennet could not have chosen better	2.7690375174867192
mr collins was eloquent in her praise	2.4314897830563136
she had been <unk> pleased to approve of both the <unk> which he had already had the honour of preaching before her	3.5841367420373382
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her <unk> of quadrille in the evening	2.7073083505196878
lady catherine was <unk> proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her	3.0292613439172964
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations	2.192345972483447
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the <unk> he had been making and had even <unk> to suggest some herself some <unk> in the <unk> up stairs	1.8329807108324359
"that is all very proper and civil i am sure " said mrs bennet "and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman	3.11187908638568
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her	2.497812535263846
does she live near you sir	1.5021174533738146
"i think you said she was a widow sir	2.6586860138338397
has she any family	1.2292136806877962
"she has one only daughter the <unk> of rosings and of very extensive property	3.0856600468869386
cried mrs bennet shaking her head "then she is better off than many girls	2.339849424724648
"she is a most charming young lady indeed	2.9095723357970034
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth	2.543345761304649
but she is perfectly amiable and often <unk> to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	2.6107071679398612
"has she been presented	1.3528149272285868
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court	2.835929475572052
"her indifferent state of health unhappily <unk> her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the <unk> court of its brightest <unk>	2.4703679459128116
i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a <unk> and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her	2.6826957952797255
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay	3.047370967703498
"you judge very properly " said mr bennet "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy	2.3389230543122803
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study	2.316316444452007
"they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with <unk> and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as <unk> an air as possible	2.232735148777284
mr bennet's expectations were fully answered	1.4787602502244719
by tea time however the <unk> had been enough and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies	2.4816289228368253
mr collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a <unk> library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read <unk>	2.610157215682537
kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed	1.9882947772567108
lydia <unk> as he opened the volume and before he had with very <unk> solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with "do you know mama that my uncle philips <unk> of turning away <unk> and if he does colonel forster will <unk> him	2.192345972483447
my aunt told me so herself on saturday	2.050880928455775
lydia was <unk> by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr collins much offended laid aside his book and said "i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <unk> though written solely for their benefit	2.154434690031884
but i will no longer <unk> my young cousin	2.666182580533196
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his <unk> at backgammon	2.7527425516045247
mr bennet accepted the <unk> observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements	2.3958813996881725
mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an <unk> and <unk> father and though he belonged to one of the <unk> he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance	1.7455628235338618
the <unk> in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity	2.1187853261287715
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his <unk> for her as his patroness <unk> with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his <unk> as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and <unk> self importance and humility	1.6496480740980204
having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	1.9429496147158305
this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate and he thought it an excellent one full of <unk> and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part	2.761699813343848
his plan did not vary on seeing them	1.851815212537266
miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views and established all his <unk> notions of what was due to <unk> and for the first evening she was his settled choice	2.980982605640439
"as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged	2.053525026457146
mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennet was <unk> the fire	3.6027344446678398
elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course	2.1261925282205585
mrs bennet <unk> up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good <unk>	2.543345761304649
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue <unk> engaged with one of the <unk> <unk> in the collection but really talking to mr bennet with little <unk> of his house and garden at hunsford	1.4873521072935114
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly	2.125255829052602
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most <unk> in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go	1.5085907086001784
in pompous <unk> on his side and civil <unk> on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton	2.6184199565537916
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them	2.6416606941164207
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentleman like appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way	2.6826957952797255
the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed	2.3582485551131795
all were struck with the <unk> air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the <unk> when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot	1.8529220216409523
mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps	2.543345761304649
this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming	3.026306348519806
his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address	2.701315067028519
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen <unk> down the street	1.8957356524063758
on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities	2.6306892353909412
bingley was the principal <unk> and miss bennet the principal object	2.8247177906479455
he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her	2.5710196635763474
mr darcy <unk> it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	1.8957356524063758
both changed colour one looked white the other red	1.90221225147995
mr wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return	2.3933330100038592
what could be the meaning of it	1.9923223138947397
it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know	2.545193131750319
in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend	2.267794300185259
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips's house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs <unk> throwing up the parlour window and loudly <unk> the invitation	1.968419447286612
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not <unk> them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr jones's shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by jane's introduction of him	1.4330125702369627
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice	2.023589647725157
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a <unk> commission in the shire	1.715437896342879
she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the <unk> but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become <unk> disagreeable fellows	1.8329807108324359
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening	2.3713737056616555
this was agreed to and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	2.577004982157879
the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits	2.5037542985375705
mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with <unk> civility that they were perfectly needless	2.784187786549439
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have <unk> either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister	2.2758459260747883
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philips's manners and politeness	2.2554936493889897
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even <unk> included him in her invitation for the next evening <unk> <unk> unknown to her before	2.085205857248754
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	2.820995455433407
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt and all mr collins's scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily <unk> the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation and was then in the house	1.566048452832833
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much <unk> but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine's drawing rooms and found that the <unk> piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the <unk> room	1.318256738556407
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional <unk> in praise of his own humble abode and the <unk> it was receiving he was happily employed <unk> the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to <unk> it all among her neighbours as soon as she could	1.5947870582948211
to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent <unk> of <unk> on the mantle piece the interval of waiting appeared very long	2.321954250288982
it was over at last however	1.8417118655491134
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentleman like set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the <unk> <unk> <unk> uncle philips <unk> <unk> wine who followed them into the room	1.79571449437164
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a <unk> season made her feel that the <unk> <unk> most thread bare <unk> might be rendered interesting by the skill of the <unk>	1.5753186734235158
with such <unk> for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and <unk>	1.8738174228603839
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist "i know little of the game at present " said he "but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life " mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason	1.7615770326037883
mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia	2.3298706575859667
at first there seemed danger of lydia's <unk> him entirely for she was a most determined <unk> but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making <unk> and exclaiming after <unk> to have attention for any one in particular	1.968419447286612
allowing for the common <unk> of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy	2.053525026457146
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved	1.5684356205176142
mr wickham began the subject himself	1.918128255230267
he <unk> how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an <unk> manner how long mr darcy had been staying there	2.750621819054035
"yes " replied wickham "his estate there is a noble one	2.7204511044825277
a clear ten thousand per annum	1.4651402580861785
"you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday	2.4235019119177172
are you much acquainted with mr darcy	1.4562582326541236
"as much as i ever wish to be " cried elizabeth warmly "i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable	3.290344562312668
"i have no right to give my opinion " said wickham "as to his being agreeable or otherwise	2.698480679082235
i am not qualified to form one	2.543422125871157
it is impossible for me to be impartial	1.7734174038418313
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire	2.3727028534807815
every body is disgusted with his pride	1.8434309605616082
"i cannot pretend to be sorry " said wickham after a short interruption "that he or that any man should not be <unk> beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen	2.610157215682537
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and <unk> manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen	2.4409353196940478
"i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man	2.318536903405532
wickham only shook his head	1.1398014934189942
"i wonder " said he at the next opportunity of speaking "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer	3.313480072030362
"i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield	3.3364174826716044
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood	3.0888670425140807
no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy	2.8433745280085376
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go	2.052757609408679
we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might <unk> to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is	2.023589647725157
his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever <unk> and the <unk> friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections	2.1187853261287715
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i <unk> believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father	2.809544269658186
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	2.6257493779054957
mr wickham began to speak on more general <unk> meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry	2.610157215682537
"it was the prospect of constant society and good society " he added "which was my chief inducement to enter the shire	2.5236484796300367
society i own is necessary to me	1.7042980061000685
i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude	2.77829167790412
i must have employment and society	2.035962011238967
"yes the late mr darcy <unk> me the next presentation of the best living in his <unk>	2.72725064297096
he was my <unk> and excessively attached to me	2.08225218566251
i cannot do justice to his kindness	1.642225372266807
he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere	3.1238150966100555
cried elizabeth "but how could that be	1.8738566568672155
how could his will be <unk>	1.575010121849531
why did not you seek legal <unk>	1.8454454486022713
"there was just such an <unk> in the terms of the <unk> as to give me no hope from law	4.098047036074208
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <unk> recommendation and to assert that i had <unk> all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing	2.1187853261287715
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it	1.968419447286612
i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely	2.98221320245263
but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me	2.7452930202263883
he deserves to be publicly <unk>	1.6518213245910527
"some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me	3.0215454297284654
till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him	2.282946115727281
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them	2.359439674744674
"but what " said she after a pause "can have been his motive	2.5854624186982456
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly	1.8547747542952628
"a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy	2.4746302023200406
had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father's uncommon attachment to me <unk> him i believe very early in life	2.571410601193267
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me	2.8428444930890544
"i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such <unk> as this	1.8957356524063758
after a few minutes reflection however she continued "i do remember his <unk> one day at netherfield of the <unk> of his <unk> of his having an unforgiving temper	3.290344562312668
his disposition must be dreadful	1.5809577014812282
"i will not trust myself on the subject " replied wickham " i can hardly be just to him	3.2122787142807243
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed "to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father	2.641442399220333
she could have added "a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being <unk> but she contented herself with "and one too who had probably been his own companion from <unk> connected together as i think you said in the closest manner	2.085205857248754
"we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together <unk> of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same <unk> care	2.6826957952797255
my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property	2.1187853261287715
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate <unk> friend	2.4573075282457983
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active <unk> and when immediately before my father's death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself	1.8529220216409523
if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be <unk> for <unk> i must call it	3.3014269698614265
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling	2.0641803599263544
but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger <unk> even than pride	2.7941453692606246
"can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good	2.0168185491949053
it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor	2.3884095733298802
family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this	2.6827534959504113
not to appear to disgrace his family to <unk> from the <unk> qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive	2.676576836880574
"what sort of a girl is miss darcy	2.054098182440728
he shook his head	1.0183170976594667
"i wish i could call her amiable	1.9822970338962802
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy	2.1325744039081678
but she is too much like her brother very very proud	2.7258992718662425
but she is nothing to me now	2.7764837338261015
she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished	2.5756130905084196
since her father's death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and <unk> her education	2.7760963788096786
after many pauses and many <unk> of other subjects elizabeth could not help <unk> once more to the first and saying "i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley	2.851050664776967
how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man	2.4845703004748985
do you know mr bingley	1.9136547826277848
"he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man	1.8092517219639923
he cannot know what mr darcy is	1.984459208067675
<unk> not but mr darcy can please where he chuses	2.2007317655237597
he does not want abilities	2.2791026767425264
among those who are at all his <unk> in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous	3.7785366756808187
his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure	2.2906459551837948
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips	2.5743782422642596
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	2.374653120819484
it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy	1.9187520990478337
"i know very well madam " said he "that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five <unk> any object	2.3713737056616555
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of <unk> little matters	2.6024462625638103
mr wickham's attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh	2.5230403797967935
"lady catherine de bourgh " she replied "has very lately given him a living	2.608511412759423
"you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy	2.7461241689100824
"no indeed i did not	1.4769793429079097
i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's connections	2.6793248994743313
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday	2.559169029883266
"her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates	3.42120049506325
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley	2.288236358540979
vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already self destined to another	2.7285972933958074
"mr collins " said she <unk> highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude <unk> him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an <unk> conceited woman	2.1187853261287715
"i believe her to be both in a great degree " replied wickham "i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were <unk> and insolent	2.4244620170823286
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she <unk> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class	1.8738174228603839
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philips's supper party but his manners recommended him to every body	2.530571275382931
whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done <unk>	2.2620323397936635
elizabeth went away with her head full of him	2.1425132791022063
she could think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent	2.192345972483447
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his <unk> at whist enumerating all the <unk> at supper and repeatedly fearing that he <unk> his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	1.6050163175336876
jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley's regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham	2.154434690031884
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other	1.8717788277982668
it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <unk> them without actual blame on either side	2.3838322132726693
do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody	2.568504684479668
<unk> as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion	3.2243409465397987
no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it	2.4877660088068536
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him	2.106671166180911
"i can much more easily believe mr bingley's being imposed on than that mr wickham should <unk> such a history of himself as he gave me last night names <unk> every thing mentioned without ceremony	2.6826957952797255
if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it	2.1186149049980543
besides there was truth in his looks	1.899693146325636
but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public	2.9378068831593973
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday	1.9187520990478337
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation	2.942727176209282
they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet's civilities	2.4591183628275513
mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card	2.615168946580944
jane <unk> to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy's looks and behaviour	2.085205857248754
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it	2.636339976612481
"while i can have my mornings to myself " said she "it is enough	2.439191081387997
i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	2.432188226613907
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak <unk> to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley's invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from <unk> a <unk> either from the <unk> or lady catherine de bourgh by <unk> to dance	1.4942339672143998
"i am by no means of opinion i assure you " said he "that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her	1.4030037231905736
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	1.7340725330234668
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins instead	2.386558622576045
her liveliness had been never worse <unk>	1.6774808844313722
there was no help for it however	2.6188309027160765
mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr collins's proposal accepted with as good a <unk> as she could	2.796780778275655
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more	2.8584173838618607
it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors	2.4244620170823286
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities <unk> herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her	1.7455628235338618
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply	2.8200425430806515
mr collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him	2.2904853254237323
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a <unk> of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once	1.8738174228603839
no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very <unk> <unk> for netherfield were got by <unk>	2.3829148470436885
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a <unk> saturday sunday and monday <unk> to kitty and lydia	2.1187853261287715
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the <unk> of red <unk> there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	2.761699813343848
she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <unk> of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening	2.321954250288982
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <unk> for mr darcy's pleasure in the <unk> invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile "i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	1.4030037231905736
this part of his intelligence though <unk> by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make	1.6744824380115346
attention forbearance patience with darcy was <unk> to wickham	2.272966008263379
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly <unk> even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked her	2.610157215682537
but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her <unk> to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary <unk> to the <unk> of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice	1.6496480740980204
the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification	2.0221031258542945
mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	2.31376570649215
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked	3.126756843445197
he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her	2.7526429950339955
"i dare say you will find him very agreeable	2.358425773795012
that would be the greatest misfortune of all	2.460064225443248
when the dancing <unk> however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	2.053525026457146
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her <unk> looks their equal amazement in beholding it	2.321954250288982
he replied and was again silent	1.7621387464945828
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with "it is your turn to say something now mr darcy	2.5169073205327366
i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of <unk>	2.8258008908484085
that reply will do for the present	1.8947558896688883
perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones	2.0769145820415638
but now we may be silent	1.7198256043930906
"do you talk by rule then while you are dancing	1.8909443138607132
one must speak a little you know	1.888474430489044
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible	2.4244620170823286
"are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine	2.9288482495691834
<unk> " replied elizabeth archly "for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds	2.6869030793926174
"this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure " said he	2.5965563294934975
"how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say	2.3830361909667936
you think it a faithful <unk> undoubtedly	2.2654207408591853
"i must not decide on my own performance	1.9546622930689377
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton	2.941937617146571
she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added "when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance	2.930988074326418
the effect was immediate	1.30586802143798
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on	2.45986449492601
"he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship " replied elizabeth with <unk> "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life	3.0127559354748157
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject	1.9655858689783585
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he <unk> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner	2.154434690031884
"i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir	2.4603965842955025
such very superior dancing is not often seen	1.910660625671255
it is evident that you belong to the first <unk>	2.096904586513445
allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place	2.232735148777284
what congratulations will then flow in	1.5860456506979592
you will not thank me for detaining you from the <unk> converse of that young lady whose <unk> eyes are also <unk> me	2.961344506103824
"i do not think we were speaking at all	2.7262767363932383
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves	2.8824560822089325
"what think you of books	1.5507118194156315
i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings	3.361491184780108
"i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject	3.0528425701589392
we may <unk> our different opinions	1.715730440566369
"the present always <unk> you in such scenes does it	2.1115397092461667
said he with a look of doubt	1.853034320302918
"yes always " she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming "i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever <unk> that your resentment once created was <unk>	2.085205857248754
you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created	2.4562964160184078
"i am " said he with a firm voice	2.3734409516817165
"and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice	1.794262746250765
"it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at <unk> "may i ask to what these questions <unk>	2.347621106702677
<unk> to the illustration of your character " said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity	3.0511962106244717
she shook her head	1.0384477984800349
"i do not get on at all	2.6517384368876553
"but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity	2.878589544622175
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her "so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham	2.5457158376921827
your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcy's steward	2.232735148777284
let me recommend you however as a friend not to give <unk> confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcy's using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner	1.9187520990478337
i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way	1.715437896342879
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it	2.5871608896112375
i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your <unk> guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better	2.534395913447713
"his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same " said elizabeth <unk> "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy's steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself	2.085205857248754
said elizabeth to herself	1.3825091286632958
"you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this	2.2769506313015944
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy	2.7218257787936575
she then sought her eldest sister who had <unk> to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley	2.791894025945948
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his <unk> and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the <unk> way for happiness	2.761699813343848
"i want to know " said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's "what you have learnt about mr wickham	2.9291776680947885
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon	3.078329095548383
"no " replied jane "i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you	3.1605379565100424
mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the <unk> and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man	1.5237960002208242
i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcy's regard	2.611969083216919
"no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton	2.2867731384804104
"this account then is what he has received from mr darcy	2.3716323333634635
but what does he say of the living	1.7261180498743982
"he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he <unk> that it was left to him conditionally only	3.106094653867218
"i have not a doubt of mr bingley's sincerity " said elizabeth warmly "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only	3.1074164645269517
mr bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is <unk> with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before	2.085205857248754
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment	2.3267912660411976
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley's regard and said all in her power to <unk> her confidence in it	2.866480881920209
on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great <unk> that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery	1.8957356524063758
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine	2.848035868435802
how wonderfully these sort of things occur	1.7525923737756133
who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly	2.57347681603835
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology	1.8756994058587348
"you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy	2.1944522282049905
i believe him to be lady catherine's nephew	2.927160473003842
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night	2.7970283572388133
elizabeth tried hard to <unk> him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance	1.6618362775387496
mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus "my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <unk> of your understanding but <unk> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <unk> and those which <unk> the <unk> for give me leave to observe that i consider the <unk> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained	1.3650078065460138
you must therefore allow me to follow the <unk> of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty	3.0439661361628243
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and <unk> study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself	2.085205857248754
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his <unk> she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident	2.9320100692405067
her cousin <unk> his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the <unk> of his lips the words <unk> " <unk> " and "lady catherine de bourgh	2.154434690031884
mr collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way	2.3713737056616555
mr collins then returned to elizabeth	1.6078473387572092
"i have no reason i assure you " said he "to be dissatisfied with my reception	2.7927881172189766
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention	2.045673549274435
it was really a very handsome thought	2.1911316029087473
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the <unk> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane	2.192345972483447
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters	2.543345761304649
her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much	2.397822461051893
when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley	1.79571449437164
it was an <unk> subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match	2.293207251647974
his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	1.8329807108324359
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and <unk> it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to <unk> her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	1.701254279852589
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <unk> whisper for to her <unk> vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them	2.053525026457146
her mother only <unk> her for being nonsensical	2.2576945390177996
"what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him	2.936473269160507
"for heaven's sake madam speak lower	1.5620283810043478
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy	2.174313792687844
you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing	2.360977490184608
nothing that she could say however had any influence	2.917026360540266
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	2.6536102659247316
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation	1.7363865544711619
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity	2.2285154292959746
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long <unk> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold <unk> and <unk>	2.3713737056616555
elizabeth now began to <unk>	1.4200200368951394
but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company	2.63843265991482
by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of <unk> was delightful to her and she began her song	2.4244620170823286
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several <unk> with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another	1.715437896342879
<unk> powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected	2.6750789233806396
elizabeth was in <unk>	1.3609465852161675
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley	2.8325311476658226
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making <unk> of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave	2.63907005001965
she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night	2.5990274711839816
he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud "that will do extremely well child	2.259623903653306
you have delighted us long enough	1.5462278776052754
let the other young ladies have time to <unk>	2.2082491683617778
mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father's speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good	2.5418313363760587
others of the party were now applied to	2.3709517577609995
"if i " said mr collins "were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman	2.053525026457146
i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <unk> too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to	2.853541119163579
the rector of a parish has much to do	1.884082085636482
in the first place he must make such an agreement for <unk> as may be <unk> to himself and not offensive to his patron	3.198003960524554
he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible	2.4244620170823286
many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man	2.192345972483447
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed	1.539926526059492
that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of <unk> her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	2.2758459260747883
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement	2.3229358611997157
she was teazed by mr collins who continued most <unk> by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others	2.610157215682537
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	2.6149463692711024
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening	2.2758459260747883
there was no <unk> upon such a project	2.3366895298029156
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good <unk> engaged mr collins's conversation to herself	2.50588826966085
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her <unk> to mr wickham and rejoiced in it	3.5638968715799844
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a <unk> of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family	1.9187520990478337
mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	2.7871121579746316
they <unk> every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a <unk> over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was <unk> mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their <unk>	1.79571449437164
mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene	1.8959790864280064
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other	3.1598743328642342
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of <unk> how tired i am	2.676449302948183
accompanied by a violent yawn	1.6529207340220669
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most <unk> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation	1.8139306939110624
bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time	2.610157215682537
of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure	2.5349085612995523
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was <unk> by mr bingley and netherfield	2.6826957952797255
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn	2.3512431460903183
mr collins made his declaration in form	1.6572871037087218
on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words "may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning	1.9429496147158305
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs bennet instantly answered "oh dear	2.5999323579479117
come kitty i want you up stairs	1.6711885832956885
mr collins must excuse me	1.3824916794079398
he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear	2.7261043163365737
i am going away myself	2.1115929113920564
"no no nonsense lizzy	1.2155833148318054
i desire you will stay where you are	1.6699203597172974
and upon elizabeth's seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added "lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins	2.128190145674629
elizabeth would not oppose such an <unk> and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by <unk> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion	1.968419447286612
"believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any <unk> rather adds to your other perfections	2.6950444099328257
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother's permission for this address	2.942727176209282
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to <unk> my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken	2.5800346962091547
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life	2.714710993155831
the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued "my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish	1.615598098439874
secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness	2.192345972483447
a clergyman like you must marry	1.7107434838714943
chuse properly chuse a <unk> for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way	2.610157215682537
this is my advice	1.3652917480932545
find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her	2.9615360796205623
allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not <unk> the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer	2.610157215682537
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will <unk> excite	2.541675292025074
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the <NUMBER> per <unk>	2.4244620170823286
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease is all that you may ever be entitled to	2.919466629148749
on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	2.782338432226395
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	1.7389806175206115
"you are too hasty sir " she cried	1.907612328592034
"you forget that i have made no answer	2.2817443673825792
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them	2.984221614824411
"i am not now to learn " replied mr collins with a formal <unk> of the hand "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first <unk> for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time	1.8139306939110624
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the <unk> ere long	3.113996708728215
"upon my word sir " cried elizabeth "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration	2.549573779628177
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time	2.4779365459017786
i am perfectly serious in my refusal	2.121183842623946
you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so	4.208759992239218
nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation	2.8456680336945417
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications	2.9901002203318305
"indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary	2.0708843644217803
you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say	2.4059353752105266
i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise	2.6866472281618057
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach	2.7211215129907798
this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled	1.7941077513392552
and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus addressed her "when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from <unk> you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character	1.3938972755249328
<unk> mr collins " cried elizabeth with some warmth "you puzzle me exceedingly	2.7944007866706904
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one	2.6826957952797255
"you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	2.3705383267197173
my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable	2.556391620582956
my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your <unk> attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you	1.8738174228603839
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications	3.008990393321728
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females	2.4816289228368253
"i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which <unk> in <unk> a respectable man	3.391711843834175
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere	2.2942004422107467
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible	2.607769189101615
can i speak <unk>	1.321176614899898
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart	2.38900171322199
"you are uniformly charming	1.1986265274497745
cried he with an air of awkward gallantry "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable	2.6386017246275575
to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated <unk> as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <unk> of an elegant female	1.6876124757881479
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs bennet having <unk> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection	1.6378937069540642
mr collins received and returned these <unk> with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her <unk> modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	1.8139306939110624
i will speak to her about it myself directly	2.1338968135925107
she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it	2.995332743210849
<unk> me for interrupting you madam " cried mr collins "but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state	2.154434690031884
if therefore she actually <unk> in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity	2.610157215682537
"sir you quite misunderstand me " said mrs bennet alarmed	2.492929148629098
"lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these	1.6173951272504752
i will go directly to mr bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure	2.950935190399209
she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library "oh	3.0854390384362036
mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an <unk>	2.4475972931589904
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she <unk> she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her	2.848035868435802
mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication	2.7748538851171483
"i have not the pleasure of understanding you " said he when she had finished her speech	2.888194398869931
"of what are you talking	1.6239223389999646
lizzy <unk> she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy	3.771594065768548
"and what am i to do on the occasion	2.0366473997241163
it seems an hopeless business	1.3770545023913996
<unk> to lizzy about it yourself	1.6606848428882073
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him	1.5957080973795508
"let her be called down	1.5570044641838177
she shall hear my opinion	1.54244536492786
mrs bennet <unk> the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library	2.502648112571527
i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage	1.9510868529629095
elizabeth replied that it was	1.3920504413741832
"very well and this offer of marriage you have refused	2.2472888471310126
we now come to the point	1.5705637631959413
your mother <unk> upon your accepting it	1.8198900990758586
"yes or i will never see her again	1.9977982353610064
"an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth	1.68560830816861
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents	3.3398221534527783
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do	2.290658614173321
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	2.942727176209282
"what do you mean mr bennet by talking in this way	2.255992383343438
you promised me to insist upon her marrying him	1.5241026698443132
"my dear " replied her husband "i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room	2.760039384282378
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be	3.441486617213088
she talked to elizabeth again and again <unk> and <unk> her by turns	3.6596818853452424
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined <unk> and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	2.7083530937770024
though her manner varied however her determination never did	1.7873383741997633
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	1.6753110230027677
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way	2.4078417494496387
his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret	2.5551488486957856
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them	2.4915744969902023
she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper "i am glad you are come for there is such fun here	2.521992358336313
what do you think has happened this morning	2.1209915045837837
mr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him	2.312387257340064
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and <unk> her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	1.715437896342879
"pray do my dear miss lucas " she added in a melancholy tone "for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves	2.761699813343848
"aye there she comes " continued mrs bennet <unk> as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at <unk> provided she can have her own way	2.7659580963054324
but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to <unk> you when your father is dead	1.968419447286612
i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you	3.173748870467271
i have done with you from this very day	2.370137615598762
i have no pleasure in talking to <unk> children	2.754842594835883
not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body	2.8083456203623096
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking	2.5375390794887513
nobody can tell what i suffer	1.7412214268050794
but it is always so	2.643813265852035
those who do not complain are never pitied	1.8590270312211052
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or <unk> her would only increase the irritation	2.3020315178422
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls "now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your <unk> and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together	1.7782794100389228
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear	1.7615770326037883
in a <unk> voice mrs bennet thus began the <unk> conversation	2.41548300605132
"my dear madam " replied he "let us be for ever silent on this point	2.37675687415568
far be it from me " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure "to resent the behaviour of your daughter	2.388689180085397
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned	2.6826957952797255
you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus <unk> my pretensions to your daughter's favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to <unk> your authority in my behalf	2.154434690031884
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my <unk> from your daughter's lips instead of your own	2.2373611166311904
but we are all liable to error	2.0725300169190692
the discussion of mr collins's offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	2.761699813343848
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	2.451942995135764
he scarcely ever spoke to her and the <unk> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were <unk> for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a <unk> relief to them all and especially to her friend	2.085205857248754
the morrow produced no <unk> of mrs bennet's ill humour or ill health	2.5204089761007284
he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	2.336149904905682
to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed	2.5073060269898164
"i found " said he "as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself	1.9429496147158305
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	2.085205857248754
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	2.7955351785219995
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately	2.326096630920441
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady's fair <unk> hand and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	2.4244620170823286
when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said "this is from caroline bingley what it <unk> has surprised me a good deal	2.591850777407148
the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again	3.000926124120191
you shall hear what she says	1.8040954432988983
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a house	2.3713737056616555
the next was in these words	1.7535398290588864
"i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence	1.8329807108324359
to these high <unk> expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the <unk> of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley's being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his	1.6265507027536246
"it is unlucky " said she after a short pause "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country	3.0807385746577225
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters	2.232735148777284
"caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter	2.4322561597464394
i will read it to you "when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles <unk> to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a <unk> <unk>	1.5160826983319609
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the <unk> but of that i <unk>	2.761699813343848
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may <unk> in the gaieties which that season generally <unk> and that your <unk> will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall <unk> you	2.321954250288982
"it is evident by this " added jane "that he comes back no more this winter	2.4125666881994006
"it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should	2.2830944794349044
"why will you think so	1.714573662556525
it must be his own doing	2.706286073671407
he is his own master	1.84095516494309
i will read you the passage which particularly <unk> me	2.4576966519233885
"mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again	2.8087248566401306
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she <unk> in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister	2.192345972483447
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable	2.6826957952797255
my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister's partiality is not <unk> me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart	1.9429496147158305
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in <unk> the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many	2.761699813343848
"what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy	1.9784775013258291
said jane as she finished it	1.7904616719376816
"is it not clear enough	1.519469170984484
does it not <unk> declare that caroline neither <unk> nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference and that if she <unk> the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly	2.321954250288982
to put me on my guard	1.7461608358528307
"yes there can for mine is totally different	1.805447777398817
will you hear it	1.2141129211934774
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy	2.904581639680423
jane shook her head	1.0384477984800349
"indeed jane you ought to believe me	2.0550165533516545
no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection	2.0694913627508082
miss bingley i am sure cannot	2.903298124525345
she is not such a simpleton	2.5158005471867377
but the case is this	1.5888605833559917
we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one <unk> she may have less trouble in <unk> a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way	1.701254279852589
but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley <unk> you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend	1.6618362775387496
"if we thought alike of miss bingley " replied jane "your representation of all this might make me quite easy	2.78140726923707
but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully <unk> any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself	2.95980069621189
you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine	3.1684642908507814
believe her to be deceived by all means	2.2499069036750914
"you must decide for yourself " said elizabeth "and if upon <unk> deliberation you find that the misery of <unk> his two sisters is more than <unk> to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him	2.232735148777284
"how can you talk so	1.6383626851778226
said jane <unk> smiling "you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate	3.0533557816356995
"i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion	2.9879514056537824
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt	2.5469423452600526
it appeared to her merely the <unk> of caroline's interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or <unk> spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one	2.4816289228368253
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	3.3067449025026154
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she <unk> it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together	1.7782794100389228
after <unk> it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses	1.8738174228603839
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins	2.8957071791183386
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	1.9757373881073956
"it keeps him in good humour " said she "and i am more obliged to you than i can express	2.9835277172120955
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	2.8819889467440443
this was very amiable but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any <unk> of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr collins's addresses by engaging them towards herself	2.610157215682537
such was miss lucas's scheme and <unk> were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	2.6826957952797255
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and <unk> to lucas lodge to throw himself at her <unk>	2.3713737056616555
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively <unk> since the adventure of wednesday	1.6744824380115346
his reception however was of the most flattering kind	2.5501604693697613
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	2.5843329841765748
in as short a time as mr collins's long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be <unk> for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	1.6744824380115346
the stupidity with which he was <unk> by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained	2.023589647725157
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity	3.0261346129815316
mr collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair	2.5596030589038796
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st james's	1.701254279852589
the whole family in short were properly <unk> on the occasion	2.3759609493979315
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's dying an old maid	2.493615405573528
charlotte herself was tolerably composed	1.4792718683877117
she had gained her point and had time to consider of it	2.3324528472811004
her reflections were in general satisfactory	1.9243895707590202
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	2.6634011205229733
but still he would be her husband	1.9661283917080767
this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it	2.8452455169694653
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person	2.5799126503476173
elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation	2.7284271361487877
she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore <unk> mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	2.848035868435802
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to <unk> and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to <unk> his prosperous love	1.7455628235338618
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them	1.7455628235338618
they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said "but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here my good sir	2.848035868435802
you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness	2.176867837961437
"my dear sir " replied mr collins "i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence	2.615934037286974
"you cannot be too much on your guard	2.377093120722947
risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence	2.321954250288982
"believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire	2.154434690031884
as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth	2.7046660184949416
mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	3.162277660168379
miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before	2.6100364974386
the possibility of mr collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <unk> of decorum and she could not help crying out <unk> to mr collins	1.6496480740980204
my dear charlotte impossible	1.7292659991512453
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon <unk> her composure and <unk> replied "why should you be surprised my dear eliza	1.9952623149688797
do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to <unk> any woman's good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you	3.2906646765505876
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable <unk> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness	2.3713737056616555
"i see what you are feeling " replied charlotte "you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you	2.8574968217108547
but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done	3.610384620638802
i am not <unk> you know	2.729626163410975
i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collins's character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state	2.4244620170823286
elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly " and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family	2.3040905970525554
charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard	2.4510521595823054
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match	3.010744416466313
the <unk> of mr collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted	3.1652808131490784
she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into <unk> she would have <unk> every better feeling to worldly advantage	2.4816289228368253
charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating picture	2.833352171430539
and to the <unk> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen	2.610157215682537
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters <unk> on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family	2.3713737056616555
with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil <unk> exclaimed "good lord	1.8738174228603839
sir william how can you tell such a story	2.1546059633236
do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy	3.081928539286789
nothing less than the complaisance of a <unk> could have borne without anger such treatment but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most <unk> courtesy	1.968419447286612
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to <unk> his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london	1.4440241885954521
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent	3.002121667352102
in the first place she persisted in <unk> the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and <unk> that the match might be broken off	2.192345972483447
two <unk> however were plainly <unk> from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been <unk> used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	2.085205857248754
nothing could console and nothing <unk> her	1.7467583117078604
nor did that day <unk> out her resentment	1.9416396453657425
mr bennet's <unk> were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter	1.8329807108324359
kitty and lydia were far from <unk> miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton	2.761699813343848
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <unk> on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs bennet's <unk> looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away	1.8529220216409523
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose <unk> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	1.968419447286612
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was <unk> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	2.6362647184684764
the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a <unk> abode in the family might have <unk>	2.848035868435802
after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an <unk> argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men	1.340042721099458
mr collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet	2.6016865768828654
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband	3.0845733508935904
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <unk>	2.852479987756078
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable	2.3994382845489812
such were the gentle <unk> of mrs bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley's continued absence	3.018456185232338
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood	2.023589647725157
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so <unk> of jane's happiness and so dishonourable to the <unk> of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring	3.290344562312668
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <unk> friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment	2.543345761304649
but as no such delicacy <unk> her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used	2.1187853261287715
it needed all jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity	1.9438668994216184
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction	2.844754793371673
he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company	2.7771042352505146
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state	2.9670958072401343
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her	2.2997180759236366
as her <unk> in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence	2.3587808412818343
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead	1.8529220216409523
she <unk> bitterly of all this to her husband	2.5156456504918094
"indeed mr bennet " said she "it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it	2.2758459260747883
let us hope for better things	1.69200785952867
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the <unk>	2.1553629137728025
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it	3.0675535099743336
"what should not you mind	1.707879596195306
"i should not mind any thing at all	2.0325630597391764
"let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility	2.708759616651377
"i never can be thankful mr bennet for any thing about the entail	2.622620620158894
why should he have it more than anybody else	2.141669536102066
"i leave it to yourself to determine " said mr bennet	2.051075281892756

egerton military library whitehall	1.0145403819983427
miss bingley's letter arrived and put an end to doubt	1.860660159037018
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country	2.2758459260747883
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort	2.7214146675597894
miss darcy's praise occupied the chief of it	1.639753080502895
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation	2.6603579261223524
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others	2.5885192134940813
to caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit	2.3400644613543964
that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <unk> friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations	1.6378937069540642
had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sister's was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself	2.3713737056616555
it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing	2.730774858678882
she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away or were suppressed by his <unk> interference whether he had been aware of jane's attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sister's situation remained the same her peace equally wounded	1.7301957388458942
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennet's leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying "oh	2.2758459260747883
that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	2.719386191689765
but i will not repine	2.413167121985704
it cannot last long	1.228425469064225
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing	2.297822128538045
"you doubt me " cried jane slightly colouring "indeed you have no reason	2.298699830829373
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all	2.7315755597655107
i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with	2.509080535908407
i have not that pain	2.7536017136177313
a little time therefore	1.2288474027576144
i shall certainly try to get the better	1.7726930598147268
with a stronger voice she soon added "i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself	2.4816289228368253
your sweetness and <unk> are really <unk> i do not know what to say to you	2.5736777933572976
i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve	2.5763152432453946
miss bennet eagerly <unk> all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection	2.1998363292731264
"nay " said elizabeth "this is not fair	2.9099658139580153
you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body	2.798919386017406
do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my <unk> on your privilege of universal good will	2.5420452951808197
there are few people whom i really love and still <unk> of whom i think well	2.6115746993866007
i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte's marriage	2.7152809071454063
in every view it is unaccountable	1.5888117278929157
they will ruin your happiness	1.3618101095476611
consider mr collins's respectability and charlotte's prudent steady character	1.7841365727544323
remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every body's sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin	2.3713737056616555
"to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart	1.9952623149688797
my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who <unk> him cannot have a proper way of thinking	2.192345972483447
you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that <unk> is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness	2.6143994426303663
"i must think your language too strong in speaking of both " replied jane "and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together	2.818338374060052
but enough of this	1.3621702237584452
you alluded to something else	1.48698654677548
you mentioned two instances	1.2251949414369787
i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk	2.66838686460229
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured	2.6311039841414683
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that <unk> us	2.6308621930991727
"and men take care that they should	1.76664270089008
"if it is <unk> done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine	3.0957716188432802
"i am far from <unk> any part of mr bingley's conduct to design " said elizabeth "but without <unk> to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery	2.610157215682537
"and do you <unk> it to either of those	2.7822076033026533
"yes to the last but if i go on i shall <unk> you by saying what i think of persons you esteem	3.067228991616653
stop me whilst you can	1.356492711248436
"you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	1.9308236336416045
"yes in <unk> with his friend	2.207677605714499
"i cannot believe it	1.1955492659557054
they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it	2.701459320399412
"your first <unk> is false	1.6826709336101717
they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride	2.610157215682537
<unk> a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy " replied jane "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing	2.778677746932993
but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's	2.774017856879837
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable	2.5375465554952235
if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed	2.801130894121395
by supposing such an affection you make every body acting <unk> and wrong and me most unhappy	2.2542047058038
do not distress me by the idea	1.9160519664433942
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	2.942727176209282
let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood	2.889401741417706
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	2.8276080473107146
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity	2.3713737056616555
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and <unk> liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day	1.8139306939110624
mrs bennet's best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer	2.4300997400254225
mr bennet treated the matter differently	1.6397285895869746
"so lizzy " said he one day "your sister is crossed in love i find	2.6870394867430987
next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then	2.1934650008399923
it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions	2.74070610844446
when is your turn to come	1.5769811269559315
you will hardly bear to be long <unk> by jane	2.4597939660573007
now is your time	1.3857157937096818
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	2.3769348622042714
let wickham be your man	1.4597166821440193
he is a pleasant fellow and would <unk> you <unk>	2.8830973670631748
"thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me	2.191186181798519
we must not all expect jane's good fortune	2.2533825585209244
"true " said mr bennet "but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may <unk> you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it	2.848035868435802
mr wickham's society was of material service in <unk> the gloom which the late <unk> occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family	2.713153500631592
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter	1.9429496147158305
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday	2.633462586099447
the pain of separation however might be <unk> on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men	2.085205857248754
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks	2.4620964711456264
on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn	3.1928231718068227
mr gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education	2.6903145242710385
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable	3.0009576788266163
mrs gardiner who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces	2.88301307776016
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard	2.3549844289587196
they had frequently been staying with her in town	2.2220179901882107
the first part of mrs gardiner's business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the <unk> fashions	2.3862543098901883
when this was done she had a less active part to play	2.449992932649117
they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister	2.373575959647247
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it	2.841661516761106
"i do not blame jane " she continued "for jane would have got mr bingley if she could	3.236212376661885
he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him	2.403884939756866
the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever	3.0423951992018265
the lucases are very <unk> people indeed sister	1.912875998329733
they are all for what they can get	2.4512981997354912
it makes me very nervous and poorly to be <unk> so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else	2.9171225907340195
however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long <unk>	2.8290306321950673
mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	2.4816289228368253
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject	1.9827292903712894
"it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane " said she	2.5581534251547127
"i am sorry it went off	2.008179364932461
but these things happen so often	1.5580559215797694
a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident <unk> them so easily <unk> her that these sort of <unk> are very frequent	2.4244620170823286
"an excellent consolation in its way " said elizabeth "but it will not do for us	2.5528681009797807
"but that expression of <unk> in <unk> is so <unk> so doubtful so <unk> that it gives me very little idea	3.263408984672377
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour's acquaintance as to a real strong attachment	2.3650133248449814
he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her	1.8184862000458384
every time they met it was more decided and remarkable	2.335265343554755
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer	2.5922128490116534
could there be finer symptoms	1.7069828677021537
is not general incivility the very <unk> of love	2.0809680595241753
of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt	2.5894012909954953
it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner	2.8693018214778165
change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything	2.4872575716346303
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister's ready <unk>	2.4785666469047563
"i hope " added mrs gardiner "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her	2.3981349183914324
we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her	2.2758459260747883
"and that is quite impossible for he is now in the <unk> of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london	2.848035868435802
my dear aunt how could you think of it	2.4771130539361397
mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a <unk> <unk> enough to <unk> him from its <unk> were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never <unk> without him	2.192345972483447
i hope they will not meet at all	2.012810295958508
but does not jane <unk> with the sister	2.580404243625235
she will not be able to help calling	3.055217412473122
"she will drop the acquaintance entirely	1.5933150116957775
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless	2.023589647725157
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends <unk> <unk> by the more natural influence of jane's attractions	2.942727176209282
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him	1.9952623149688797
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement	3.0761305813882536
when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered <unk> by elizabeth's warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both	2.232735148777284
without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment	1.9429496147158305
to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers	2.3106806688631694
about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged	2.7384237298102065
they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father five years before it was yet in his power to give her <unk> intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring	2.085205857248754
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well	2.5095776754587127
here consequently was an <unk> subject of discourse	1.8514442843912617
in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in <unk> her <unk> of praise on the character of its late possessor she was <unk> both him and herself	2.6826957952797255
on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy's treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a <unk> which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy	1.8957356524063758
mrs gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on "you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are <unk> against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly	1.8139306939110624
seriously i would have you be on your guard	2.242594763967678
do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent	2.458837977025393
i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better	2.942727176209282
but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you	2.652590175917146
you have sense and we all expect you to use it	2.18232072509837
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure	2.1351148776834576
you must not disappoint your father	2.0335113824302584
"my dear aunt this is being serious indeed	1.8696339517894787
"yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise	2.932384659870532
"well then you need not be under any alarm	2.1808747234776216
i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too	2.6675060565183806
<unk> you are not serious now	2.0885230587861567
"i beg your pardon	1.0161638950003151
i see the imprudence of it	1.7860366305157915
that abominable mr darcy	1.1323132956626782
my father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to <unk> it	2.9165928930072997
my father however is partial to mr wickham	1.7463489236709167
in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be <unk> than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be <unk> to resist	1.539926526059492
all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry	2.9176260149783304
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object	2.7295508822339993
when i am in company with him i will not be wishing	3.289412272999402
in short i will do my <unk> "perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often	2.5896562422813374
at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him	2.0893667729656986
but do not imagine that he is always here so often	2.9387524296568865
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week	2.7574255739609383
you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends	2.907662173418697
but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied	2.8695360405087897
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented	2.761699813343848
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy	2.543345761304649
as they went down stairs together charlotte said "i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	2.490422741528191
" that you certainly shall	1.615950580493676
"and i have another favour to ask	1.9943903008378998
will you come and see me	1.8183193126153165
"we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire	2.00015306071107
"i am not likely to leave kent for some time	2.508729957557319
promise me therefore to come to hunsford	1.7805740986943122
elizabeth could not refuse though she <unk> little pleasure in the visit	2.9625273010586968
"my father and maria are to come to me in march " added charlotte "and i hope you will consent to be of the party	2.8953006868999878
the wedding took place the bride and <unk> set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual	2.942727176209282
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to <unk> as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was	2.543345761304649
charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	1.715437896342879
she wrote cheerfully seemed <unk> with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	2.527049244095846
the house furniture neighbourhood and <unk> were all to her taste and lady catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging	2.477187406487679
it was mr collins's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys	1.7301957388458942
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is	2.353172950557881
jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline	2.581888235689093
she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost "my aunt " she continued "is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street	2.053525026457146
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	2.925399710164219
i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her	2.032772783152847
i enquired after their brother of course	1.8490322930873557
he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him	3.015981143274763
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner	2.1691960336325877
i wish i could see her	1.8987199631591056
my visit was not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out	2.712431154632999
i dare say i shall soon see them here	2.7331982134105
elizabeth shook her head over this letter	1.8734910581145012
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister's being in town	2.456381855154123
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him	2.157718066059069
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention	3.062566673805866
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and <unk> every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the <unk> of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer	2.1187853261287715
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt	2.8903034888924495
"my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of <unk> in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me	2.848035868435802
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again	2.942727176209282
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time	2.4022659062012224
when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer	1.79571449437164
i pity though i cannot help blaming her	2.118425750489496
she was very wrong in <unk> me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side	2.8725217603853146
but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it	3.0795695040055557
i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so <unk> dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable	1.9429496147158305
i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago	2.799755597031637
he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy	2.3713737056616555
i cannot understand it	1.1970481896550436
if i were not afraid of judging <unk> i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this	3.280026156607013
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the <unk> kindness of my dear uncle and aunt	2.9007687521351575
let me hear from you very soon	2.1593284682054232
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty	2.6524436134993334
pray go to see them with sir william and maria	2.631296122753475
i am sure you will be very comfortable there	3.583614452274272
this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be <unk> by the sister at least all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	2.761699813343848
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions	2.865751937569871
his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcy's sister as by wickham's account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away	2.053525026457146
the sudden <unk> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now <unk> himself agreeable but elizabeth less clear <unk> perhaps in his case than in charlotte's did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	2.1187853261287715
nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <unk> her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy	2.232735148777284
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on "i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and <unk> passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil	1.8529220216409523
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king	2.1731618216578363
i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl	3.261226459428574
there can be no love in all this	2.008065310211912
my watchfulness has been <unk> and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i <unk> in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance	2.6826957952797255
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly	1.6258039273944205
kitty and lydia take his <unk> much more to heart than i do	2.750155991775058
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford	1.9859606778365588
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty	2.543345761304649
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and <unk> her disgust of mr collins	2.4900560439536896
the journey would moreover give her a <unk> at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay	3.040309551150223
every thing however went on <unk> and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch	2.4315528000377777
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter	2.56451128898255
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be	2.494781198930613
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	2.321954250288982
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment <unk> her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always <unk> there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing	1.353876180022544
sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as <unk> <unk> as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise	2.321954250288982
elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir william's too long	2.506509303988787
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information	2.523163732128028
on the stairs were a <unk> of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower	2.232735148777284
the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in <unk> and <unk> and the evening at one of the <unk>	3.285814500243774
it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long	2.5444578581210293
mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch street and repeated <unk> <unk> at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance	2.4816289228368253
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's <unk> and complimented her on bearing it so well	2.1428664620216407
"but my dear elizabeth " she added "what sort of girl is miss king	3.0291167731680835
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary	2.1814081178245077
"pray my dear aunt what is the difference in <unk> affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive	2.6735580622396764
where does discretion end and <unk> begin	1.7423310744725833
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary	2.4816289228368253
"if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think	2.765894096026423
"she is a very good kind of girl i believe	2.58834387486097
i know no harm of her	1.3195509408483266
"but he paid her not the smallest attention till her <unk> death made her mistress of this fortune	2.490530093215591
"no why should he	1.2271281858169723
if it was not <unk> for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor	2.4816289228368253
"but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event	2.247930960651471
"a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant <unk> which other people may observe	2.390844801468971
if she does not object to it why should we	2.3392904225891358
" her not objecting does not justify him	1.7585775807796702
it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling	1.887955132338017
"well " cried elizabeth "have it as you choose	2.637486913499149
he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish	2.0305278690746444
"no lizzy that is what i do not choose	3.03245272121133
i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	3.0131046379876056
if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better	2.803997233812339
i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him	2.737997536721188
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all	1.9234456130485948
"take care lizzy that speech <unk> strongly of disappointment	1.781329250902162
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	2.610157215682537
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us " said mrs gardiner "but perhaps to the lakes	2.651191982175088
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	2.864725870402384
"my dear dear aunt " she <unk> cried "what delight	2.3264757102682525
you give me fresh life and <unk>	1.9254573412542226
adieu to disappointment and <unk>	1.3964337095035042
what are men to <unk> and mountains	2.3700561945368768
we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen	2.2012060430817377
lakes mountains and <unk> shall not be <unk> together in our <unk> nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation	2.559812986224735
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers	2.029077275137251
every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight	1.9429496147158305
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side	1.6895520331695202
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	2.8616658538915805
the garden <unk> to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the <unk> <unk> every thing declared they were <unk>	3.496866991946111
mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the <unk> and smiles of the whole party	2.6826957952797255
she saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	2.321954250288982
they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with <unk> formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment	1.968419447286612
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his <unk> and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	2.023589647725157
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not <unk> she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte	2.9089882021516096
once or twice she could discern a <unk> blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear	2.3088659239375975
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the <unk> to the <unk> to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a <unk> in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the <unk> of which he attended himself	1.7615770326037883
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the <unk> of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible	2.4816289228368253
he could number the <unk> in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant <unk>	2.9849849604502094
but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house	2.154434690031884
it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground	2.334874631876606
from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two <unk> but the ladies not having <unk> to encounter the remains of a white <unk> turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help	1.79571449437164
it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit	2.520038304734852
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed "yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the <unk> sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her	2.085205857248754
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming	2.558080911322775
we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home	2.2678567976676907
i should say one of her ladyship's carriages for she has several	2.6363344361342462
"lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed " added charlotte "and a most attentive neighbour	2.5071902772802015
"very true my dear that is exactly what i say	1.9843457005219447
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference	2.547379003240396
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment to understand her address in <unk> and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well	1.7782794100389228
she had also to <unk> how her visit would pass the quiet <unk> of their usual employments the vexatious <unk> of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings	2.8055262526891074
a lively imagination soon settled it all	1.7107252261698735
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her	1.9952623149688797
she opened the door and met maria in the <unk> place who breathless with agitation cried out "oh my dear eliza	2.635905694422139
i will not tell you what it is	2.8360909310658777
make haste and come down this moment	2.026021668360597
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate	2.321954250288982
"and is this all	1.3720755834907914
"i expected at least that the <unk> were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter	2.5519146247668396
my dear " said maria quite shocked at the mistake "it is not lady catherine	2.278610586960565
the other is miss de bourgh	1.553510398292022
only look at her	1.2294549714228076
she is quite a little creature	1.9170826192784867
who would have thought she could be so thin and small	2.7893325590907208
why does she not come in	1.6804328898592589
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in	2.6148597772047886
"she looks sickly and cross	1.3430634270569233
yes she will do for him very well	2.2659034444388673
she will make him a very proper wife	2.269877206532463
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeth's high diversion was stationed in the <unk> in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly <unk> whenever miss de bourgh looked that way	2.154434690031884
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house	2.878941888614082
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day	2.4816289228368253
mr collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	2.14329406627711
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	1.7782794100389228
i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen	2.5693423429698936
about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	1.912112085495615
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings	2.9349985878124034
when the ladies were <unk> for the toilette he said to elizabeth "do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your <unk>	2.6624459709579926
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter	2.051885110503621
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more	2.860941881425178
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being <unk> dressed	2.604120389720866
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved	2.4274032463073065
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much <unk> to be kept waiting for her dinner	2.906919657269323
such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st james's	2.1187853261287715
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park	2.3668220981404087
every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to <unk> and was but slightly affected by his <unk> of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the <unk> altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh	1.7301957388458942
when they ascended the steps to the hall maria's alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm	2.258585823369825
elizabeth's courage did not fail her	1.525698693186001
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her <unk> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere <unk> of money and rank she thought she could witness without <unk>	2.848035868435802
from the entrance hall of which mr collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an <unk> chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sitting	2.321954250288982
her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary	2.085205857248754
in spite of having been at st james's sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look	1.7455628235338618
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly	2.3831358978931494
lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked features which might once have been handsome	2.4116348045293785
her air was not <unk> nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank	3.2607228638498085
she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self importance and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented	1.9952623149688797
there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies	1.9524269100406244
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were <unk> and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a <unk> in the proper direction before her eyes	1.8529220216409523
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer	2.192345972483447
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of <unk> which mr collins had promised and as he had likewise <unk> he took his seat at the <unk> of the table by her ladyship's desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater	1.8957356524063758
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them	2.4293043053424936
the party did not supply much conversation	1.6016257015604283
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time	2.232735148777284
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed	2.448403360333853
maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	2.723596075388197
when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in <unk> her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment <unk>	1.9187520990478337
she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be <unk> in so small a family as her's and <unk> her as to the care of her <unk> and her poultry	1.9187520990478337
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention which could furnish her with an occasion of <unk> to others	2.698638638738974
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl	2.1187853261287715
she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mother's <unk> name	1.9952623149688797
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly	2.243366061140057
lady catherine then observed "your father's estate is entailed on mr collins i think	2.0430438193718174
for your sake " turning to charlotte "i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for <unk> estates from the female line	2.659728064117126
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family	2.8312965023409022
do you play and sing miss bennet	1.6279953560411118
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you	2.633399549307339
our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day	2.147963758177881
do your sisters play and sing	1.4483436198396233
<unk> of them does	1.6660727206690877
"why did not you all learn	2.2708190403121957
the miss <unk> all play and their father has not so good an income as your's	2.4059059403075813
"no not at all	1.0798579065880527
"what none of you	1.387207661541952
"that is very strange	1.6523643423361418
but i suppose you had no opportunity	2.3931452592688123
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters	2.270916579710304
"my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london	2.4953584485162343
"has your governess left you	1.3686316689707698
"we never had any governess	1.811432335915937
how was that possible	1.3654975011943966
five daughters brought up at home without a governess	1.8973913566522014
i never heard of such a thing	1.975461234217831
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education	2.3963756194236283
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case	2.9579148170530014
who attended to you	1.3824700217713304
without a governess you must have been neglected	2.703236135035724
<unk> with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means	2.366078990664212
we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary	2.511052785342626
those who chose to be idle certainly might	1.993322827069439
"aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one	3.141596433535206
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out	2.326000992110769
four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her	2.3713737056616555
she <unk> miss <unk> a treasure	1.8776555677374414
<unk> catherine ' said she <unk> have given me a treasure	2.5893747506041547
are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet	1.9975179583854439
what all five out at once	1.5025236017497408
and you only the second	1.5016420540601834
the younger ones out before the elder are married	1.9464628251557954
your younger sisters must be very young	2.484356863972011
perhaps she is full young to be much in company	2.2428654946463307
but really ma'am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early	2.543345761304649
i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind	2.595563659794007
"upon my word " said her ladyship "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person	2.5279038763333377
pray what is your age	2.276423835468951
"with three younger sisters grown up " replied elizabeth smiling "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it	2.568184410525966
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	2.8219847753135303
"you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age	3.1322017148806323
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed	2.122083053089588
lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at <unk> the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party	2.4816289228368253
their table was <unk> stupid	1.5391907984596882
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light	2.4604844188676482
a great deal more passed at the other table	2.350513263933328
lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself	2.888314471334017
when lady catherine and her daughter had <unk> as long as they chose the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to mrs collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered	2.7329084582520977
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow	2.4028085199074796
as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlotte's sake she made more favourable than it really was	2.3713737056616555
but her commendation though <unk> her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands	3.0021527597913913
sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled and of her <unk> such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with	2.321954250288982
while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <unk> and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road	1.4440241885954521
the room in which the ladies sat was <unk>	2.606151110581011
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better <unk> room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement	1.6265507027536246
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day	1.9429496147158305
she not <unk> stopped at the parsonage and had a few <unk> conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	2.9415459209440677
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <unk> to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours	1.9187520990478337
now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits	2.9137323595836992
she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collins's <unk> of meat were too large for her family	1.79571449437164
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active <unk> in her own parish the <unk> concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins and whenever any of the <unk> were disposed to be <unk> discontented or too poor she <unk> forth into the village to settle their <unk> silence their complaints and <unk> them into <unk> and <unk>	1.5753186734235158
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the <unk> of the first their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the <unk> reach	1.79571449437164
this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors	2.1187853261287715
her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity	1.8957356524063758
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	2.234223627181355
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important	2.868930342737981
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself	1.353876180022544
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence	1.9429496147158305
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects	2.051527075302663
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	2.192345972483447
charlotte had seen them from her husband's room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding "i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility	2.484609645374572
mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me	2.5433639155517667
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure	2.4244620170823286
elizabeth merely <unk> to him without saying a word	1.8989230805510184
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to any body	2.1187853261287715
she answered him in the usual way and after a moment's pause added "my eldest sister has been in town these three months	2.9544869496621886
have you never happened to see her there	2.434838602687809
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet	1.968419447286612
the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away	2.6747145667020087
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings	2.762253028537873
it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening	1.7615770326037883
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had only seen at church	2.863598949744994
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing room	2.402624288520203
her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room	1.968419447286612
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	2.6172972540441513
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out "what is that you are saying fitzwilliam	2.192345972483447
what is it you are talking of	1.9690260249812184
what are you telling miss bennet	1.8552306713654998
let me hear what it is	1.6748788052637587
"we are speaking of music madam " said he when no longer able to avoid a reply	2.3432984881549457
then pray speak aloud	1.227759227686727
it is of all subjects my delight	2.046497478908963
i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music	2.6521923167455776
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste	2.3853586091044248
and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply	2.18679630947615
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully	2.638977588456629
how does georgiana get on darcy	1.5549831678463841
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's <unk>	2.046027194998918
"i am very glad to hear such a good account of her " said lady catherine "and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not <unk> a great deal	2.610157215682537
"i assure you madam " he replied "that she does not need such advice	2.8006581671763775
she practises very constantly	1.2293154780828128
"so much the better	1.2129744722719746
it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account	2.93128672027174
i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice	2.462202094194845
i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs <unk> room	1.968419447286612
she would be in <unk> way you know in that part of the house	2.8677622707891657
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding and made no answer	2.145635122307204
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument	2.691479213758765
lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair <unk> countenance	2.085205857248754
elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an <unk> smile and said "you mean to <unk> me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me	2.543345761304649
but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well	2.586946220361765
there is a <unk> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others	2.8935945718369194
my courage always <unk> with every attempt to <unk> me	2.1105980585125987
"i shall not say that you are mistaken " he replied "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <unk> opinions which in fact are not your own	1.8957356524063758
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say	2.761699813343848
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit	2.610157215682537
indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very <unk> too for it is provoking me to <unk> and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear	2.023589647725157
"i am not afraid of you " said he smilingly	2.82638835313076
"pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of " cried colonel fitzwilliam	2.3599679277671815
"i should like to know how he behaves among strangers	2.5048284985907547
"you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful	1.9567789112587182
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did	3.0970757339174853
he danced only four dances	1.099194362861826
i am sorry to pain you but so it was	2.2538252324623667
he danced only four dances though gentlemen were <unk> and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner	2.5995659582898694
mr darcy you cannot deny the fact	2.145962496048127
"true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room	2.114331651341047
well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next	2.1069309978076842
my fingers wait your orders	1.3839676836814816
"perhaps " said darcy "i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	2.7184924578906413
"shall we ask your cousin the reason of this	2.068190532870272
said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam	1.4704054943043163
"shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers	2.8466981680273182
"i can answer your question " said fitzwilliam <unk> applying to him	2.3591256415592867
it is because he will not give himself the trouble	2.3635025422577276
"i certainly have not the talent which some people possess " said darcy "of conversing easily with those i have never seen before	2.6144199643391435
i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done	2.2303580188434053
"my fingers " said elizabeth "do not move over this instrument in the <unk> manner which i see so many <unk> do	3.1057530875431993
they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression	2.4671706962081266
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of <unk>	3.333921883923792
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution	3.116059225664064
darcy smiled and said "you are perfectly right	2.0350729066075792
you have employed your time much better	1.6680233065766499
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting	2.276732641178927
we neither of us perform to strangers	1.7841237600736353
elizabeth immediately began playing again	1.4397510642075178
she has a very good notion of <unk> though her taste is not equal to <unk>	2.7616927185001012
anne would have been a delightful <unk> had her health allowed her to learn	2.8928093779225263
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation	1.715437896342879
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor	2.3713737056616555
as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the room	1.9429496147158305
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within	3.007445102886928
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	2.404660203847885
it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this <unk> recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed "how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy	1.968419447286612
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before	3.1195956657601265
he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london	2.7480800853726985
<unk> so i thank you	1.3019012923543472
"i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future	2.9050870379101608
he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing	2.6299563529106353
"if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there	2.761699813343848
elizabeth made no answer	1.044281694460232
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him	2.894339396514692
he took the hint and soon began with "this seems a very comfortable house	2.1701616497343785
lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford	2.7516028289105683
"i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object	3.140549811633981
"mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	2.0261391157520476
she seems perfectly happy however and in a <unk> light it is certainly a very good match for her	3.1192425822959047
"it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends	3.5122439262225873
"an easy distance do you call it	1.8325956855255312
it is nearly fifty miles	1.307186420427965
"and what is fifty miles of good road	1.904243587647269
yes i call it a very easy distance	2.0736760153889273
"i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match " cried elizabeth	2.4021625392309662
"it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire	3.0068275599510716
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far	2.133630596325725
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered "i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family	2.023589647725157
the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances	2.1610006919709495
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling <unk> distance becomes no evil	2.4104647989376846
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent <unk> and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance	2.4244620170823286
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said " you cannot have a right to such very strong <unk> attachment	2.7428741746578678
you cannot have been always at longbourn	2.08936110898517
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a <unk> from the table and glancing over it said in a <unk> voice "are you pleased with kent	2.7055718243534947
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and <unk> and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk	2.6826957952797255
the tête à tête surprised them	1.5452333696544425
but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte's wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year	1.8957356524063758
all field <unk> were over	1.5386023431185476
within doors there was lady catherine books and a <unk> table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the <unk> of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	1.8529220216409523
they called at various times of the morning sometimes <unk> sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt	2.665613549454613
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand	2.4429364893945866
colonel fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out	1.8329807108324359
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was <unk>	2.9357054919745527
it was an earnest <unk> <unk> but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind	2.797904173715387
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam	1.9565103915758697
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy	2.3490350267831697
she felt all the perverseness of the <unk> that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite <unk> of hers	2.3713737056616555
yet it did and even a third	1.7836513828248104
it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary <unk> for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her	2.2758459260747883
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third <unk> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collins's happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too	1.474142020110622
his words seemed to <unk> it	1.6516056811140185
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts	1.8601728306945422
she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter	2.461599082489579
it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage	2.9500920326506055
she was engaged one day as she walked in re <unk> jane's last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her	2.053525026457146
putting away the letter immediately and <unk> a smile she said "i did not know before that you ever walked this way	2.837610610496153
are you going much farther	1.3895539319483887
"no i should have turned in a moment	2.5010594047323376
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together	2.3754628296003455
"do you certainly leave kent on saturday	1.6958090009985494
"yes if darcy does not put it off again	1.9729185874142026
but i am at his disposal	2.633836154118053
he <unk> the business just as he pleases	2.5010953968170493
"and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice	2.6498704777244226
"he likes to have his own way very well " replied colonel fitzwilliam	2.316647476853582
"but so we all do	1.6341851105751253
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor	2.696482386700318
a younger son you know must be <unk> to self denial and dependence	2.3881274148371787
"in my opinion the younger son of an <unk> can know very little of either	2.7214357910046774
now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence	1.8706107446538787
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	2.3778570777261305
"these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many <unk> of that nature	2.8423408127051424
but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money	2.193833636471652
<unk> where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do	2.3837348154570708
<unk> habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money	2.4876296212198863
"is this " thought elizabeth <unk> for me	2.2905265114347624
and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone "and pray what is the usual price of an <unk> younger son	2.564295534660363
unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	2.4768119090516696
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said "i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal	2.4816289228368253
but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her	2.8455802291829757
"no " said colonel fitzwilliam "that is an advantage which he must divide with me	2.427492382245737
and pray what sort of <unk> do you make	2.4751029880420976
does your charge give you much trouble	1.7627967652193124
young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way	2.7374273454798588
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth	2.232735148777284
i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most <unk> creatures in the world	2.9765609117125966
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley	2.486714295792899
i think i have heard you say that you know them	2.1586445575062774
"i know them a little	1.6064950718913587
their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy's	2.874204741308922
yes " said elizabeth drily "mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a <unk> deal of care of him	3.033597278538246
from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him	2.581942759943471
it was all conjecture	2.1314066323154712
"it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady's family it would be an unpleasant thing	2.942727176209282
"you may depend upon my not mentioning it	1.5848809418349776
"and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley	3.031509626394764
what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a <unk> of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	1.6378937069540642
"did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference	2.004851973233959
"i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady	1.6473364189837396
"and what arts did he use to separate them	1.910582663199771
"he did not talk to me of his own arts " said fitzwilliam smiling	2.9314471325214635
"he only told me what i have now told you	2.1087818604780413
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart <unk> with indignation	2.4047432375964672
after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so <unk>	2.2821745633738626
"your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings	1.6506337331387568
why was he to be the judge	2.7043421847637306
"i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy	2.3713737056616555
"but " she continued recollecting herself "as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him	2.8777424140644547
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case	3.021105651197729
"that is not an unnatural surmise " said fitzwilliam "but it is <unk> the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly	3.066440998020606
this was spoken <unk> but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage	2.3713737056616555
there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard	3.236529105835502
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected	2.587815947724238
there could not <unk> in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have such <unk> influence	3.548716925201282
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	2.761699813343848
if his own vanity however did not <unk> him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer	3.046989570903508
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have <unk>	2.942727176209282
"there were some very strong objections against the lady " were colonel fitzwilliam's words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london	2.249893484209185
all loveliness and goodness as she is	1.7312158950767007
her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating	2.151877286293778
neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some <unk> has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach	2.665619845205804
when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister	1.5085907086001784
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a <unk> and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea	2.085205857248754
mrs collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home	2.192345972483447
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent	2.4244620170823286
elizabeth noticed every sentence <unk> the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal	2.854557670254179
mr darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a <unk> sense of her sister's sufferings	3.384304435209417
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	1.9187520990478337
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him	2.1187853261287715
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little <unk> by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her	2.023589647725157
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the room	2.5183144695251185
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health <unk> his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better	2.551025655397204
he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	2.214371306159311
elizabeth was surprised but said not a word	1.5968468307372625
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began "in vain have i struggled	2.444823577689543
it will not do	1.40950502033099
my feelings will not be repressed	2.457766869747048
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression	1.7841803063206654
she stared coloured doubted and was silent	1.7297668651096123
he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be <unk> and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride	3.290344562312668
his sense of her inferiority of its being a <unk> of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit	2.192345972483447
in spite of her deeply <unk> dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his <unk> language she lost all compassion in anger	1.8529220216409523
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand	2.321954250288982
as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer	2.9008279885799726
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security	2.2561285209166604
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said "in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however <unk> they may be returned	2.053525026457146
it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you	2.559893520758715
but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly	2.945210582727881
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one	2.1101641063962857
it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration	2.924746206144894
the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in <unk> it after this explanation	2.6830797727682363
mr darcy who was <unk> against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise	2.846640167634167
his complexion became pale with anger and the <unk> of his mind was visible in every feature	2.740720840630469
he was <unk> for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have <unk> it	3.155597259723245
i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected	2.3844313578970056
but it is of small importance	2.576898446286524
"i might as well enquire " replied she "why with so evident a design of offending and <unk> me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character	2.4244620170823286
but i have other <unk>	2.2027318093302415
you know i have	1.6714441759825855
had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of <unk> perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister	2.053525026457146
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued	2.29482216231874
"i have every reason in the world to think ill of you	2.7190186709835347
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there	1.841503139742797
you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of <unk> them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and <unk> the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the <unk> kind	1.8957356524063758
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly <unk> by any feeling of <unk>	3.0319655334510065
"can you deny that you have done it	2.15804386797275
with <unk> tranquillity he then replied "i have no wish of <unk> that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success	2.761699813343848
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself	2.595292509513767
elizabeth disdained the appearance of <unk> this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to <unk> her	2.5744039906056444
"but it is not merely this affair " she continued "on which my dislike is founded	2.9626749637938783
long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided	2.579172950388011
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham	2.286902260072817
on this subject what can you have to say	2.7273252175737217
or under what <unk> can you here impose upon others	2.0625195144214947
"who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him	2.112581232862318
repeated darcy <unk> "yes his misfortunes have been great indeed	1.8346224158929474
"and of your <unk> " cried elizabeth with energy	2.8803125338395508
"you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty	2.1134537687367825
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his <unk>	2.555542764163491
you have done all this	1.6545896919773497
"and this " cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room "is your opinion of me	2.644537196972934
this is the estimation in which you hold me	2.4771320021038967
but perhaps " added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her "these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my <unk> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design	2.321954250288982
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater <unk> concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being <unk> by <unk> <unk> inclination by reason by reflection by every thing	2.610157215682537
they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections	2.3531359924497406
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own	2.4274955252309995
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said "you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner	1.701254279852589
"from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners <unk> me with the <unk> belief of your <unk> your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry	1.4806572771858608
"you have said quite enough madam	1.6245979045088381
i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	2.518580126653451
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great	2.449052839343694
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour	2.0694049863245336
her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it	2.0601521653338977
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy	2.1766820639003153
that he should have been in love with her for so many months	3.5589460952922516
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible	2.2758459260747883
but his pride his abominable pride his <unk> avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in <unk> though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	1.701254279852589
she continued in very <unk> reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation and hurried her away to her room	2.8439970597833035
elizabeth <unk> the next morning to the same thoughts and <unk> which had at length closed her eyes	3.0958401071413606
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	2.4816289228368253
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the <unk> road	2.4816289228368253
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground	2.639953163275118
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park	2.4945112512086833
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the <unk> of the early trees	3.162277660168379
she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr darcy she was directly <unk>	2.2758459260747883
she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate	3.078798708624708
will you do me the honour of reading that letter	2.4846561967883063
and then with a slight bow turned again into the <unk> and was soon out of sight	3.101455054550969
with no expectation of pleasure but with the <unk> curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two <unk> of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand	2.543345761304649
the envelope itself was likewise full	1.4952124979688197
pursuing her way along the lane she then began it	2.0859390352033995
it was dated from rosings at eight o'clock in the morning and was as follows <unk> not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so <unk> to you	2.085205857248754
i write without any intention of <unk> you or <unk> myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the <unk> and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read	1.8738174228603839
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice	2.4043219810556713
<unk> offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal <unk> you last night laid to my charge	2.6645063040393078
but from the <unk> of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read	2.4816289228368253
if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's i can only say that i am sorry	2.7561761117939865
i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country	3.0254132873127424
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment	3.2471645814491943
i had often seen him in love before	2.2232718270978786
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be <unk>	2.770518975205039
from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him	2.661948869418412
your sister i also watched	1.8505796863202084
her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening's <unk> that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any <unk> of sentiment	2.192345972483447
if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error	3.3894039540894196
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable	2.2683437974766374
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my <unk> and <unk> are not usually <unk> by my hopes or fears	3.162277660168379
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason	2.927888462585021
my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me	2.1187853261287715
but there were other causes of <unk> causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me	2.4936447360939553
these causes must be stated though briefly	1.6278728123830943
the situation of your mother's family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father	2.4055613447532362
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both	1.715437896342879
i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection	2.3713737056616555
he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning	2.63795697425203
his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our <unk> of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in <unk> their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london	2.3713737056616555
we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice	2.6805658915012818
i described and <unk> them earnestly	2.185788915615817
but however this <unk> might have <unk> or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would <unk> have prevented the marriage had it not been <unk> by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister's indifference	2.321954250288982
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard	2.6265103159434937
but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own	2.2441677823347828
to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point	2.862337289357543
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment	2.4696735279132427
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much	1.8661342017647018
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town	2.232735148777284
i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it	2.904546085916298
perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me	1.6549456577726553
it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer	3.109937932421225
if i have wounded your sister's feelings it was <unk> done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them	2.848035868435802
with respect to that other more <unk> <unk> of having injured mr wickham i can only <unk> it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family	3.162277660168379
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can <unk> more than one witness of <unk> veracity	3.1733395407669556
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed	1.8329807108324359
my father supported him at school and afterwards at <unk> most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education	2.6826957952797255
my father was not only fond of this young man's society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it	2.4244620170823286
as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner	3.3187777434424044
the <unk> <unk> the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have	1.9429496147158305
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <unk> his real character	2.548917555849764
it adds even another motive	1.3808463362563204
my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his <unk> in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant	1.701254279852589
there was also a <unk> of one thousand pounds	2.3173300857922183
his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited	1.8139306939110624
he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <unk>	2.6902190601649023
i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to <unk> to his proposal	2.977532778554504
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman	3.385559943720072
the business was therefore soon settled	1.8703442928868388
all connection between us seemed now <unk>	1.7119554931957182
i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town	2.4429776513958292
in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and <unk>	2.4812297546647386
for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation	2.6826957952797255
his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad	2.6839592193157444
he had found the law a most <unk> study and was now absolutely resolved on being <unk> if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my <unk> father's intentions	1.7782794100389228
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for <unk> every repetition of it	2.396828405210825
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his <unk> to myself	2.9497786375365584
after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt	1.9363067382275432
how he lived i know not	1.5250011517788382
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	2.079968214705157
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to <unk> to any human being	2.843691934709744
having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy	2.375178093806709
my sister who is more than ten years my <unk> was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself	2.556012047043836
about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who <unk> over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her <unk> and <unk> he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement	1.3894954943731377
she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself	2.7319348307057063
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted	2.3267475566609557
regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public <unk> but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge	2.8146474267615025
mr wickham's chief object was <unk> my sister's fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of <unk> himself on me was a strong inducement	2.8944848999769803
his revenge would have been complete indeed	2.4955016819776414
this madam is a faithful <unk> of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me <unk> of cruelty towards mr wickham	2.4816289228368253
i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at	2.7263438681358014
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination	2.869920907630879
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night	2.103849919634936
for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the <unk> of my father's will has been <unk> acquainted with every particular of these transactions	2.023589647725157
i will only add god bless you	1.7582392565174116
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents	2.80636436187855
but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a <unk> of emotion they excited	3.1007659801501477
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	2.2424481295854735
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal	2.4816289228368253
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield	2.5526282026429254
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of <unk> and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes	2.610157215682537
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not <unk> but haughty	2.8637617707445457
it was all pride and <unk>	2.1652985475460973
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when she read with somewhat <unk> attention a relation of events which if true must <unk> every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of <unk>	1.79571449437164
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her	1.7250016455043375
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming "this must be false	2.7367338575024185
this must be the <unk> falsehood	2.503746670412262
and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again	2.4244620170823286
in this <unk> state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	1.7301957388458942
so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great	2.388955464248339
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err	1.9952623149688797
on both sides it was only assertion	2.5256490571500345
again she read on	1.3489304788599572
the extravagance and general <unk> which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham's charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice	2.619072674700591
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance	2.4816289228368253
of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself	2.596119757433419
as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring	3.3231490433158393
his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue	2.30412858181638
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished <unk> of integrity or benevolence that might <unk> him from the attacks of mr darcy or at least by the <unk> of virtue atone for those <unk> errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	1.79571449437164
but no such recollection <unk> her	1.7947157059879846
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was <unk> for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs and whose character she had no reason to question	1.6618362775387496
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr philips's	2.735022600244133
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	1.8008498162453046
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before	2.638437354826277
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct	3.1559897977925817
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had <unk> the netherfield ball the very next week	2.4244620170823286
she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr darcy's character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son	1.7301957388458942
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned	2.7367005487442695
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and <unk> mercenary and the <unk> of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to <unk> at any thing	2.543345761304649
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <unk> shewn	2.4244620170823286
every <unk> <unk> in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther <unk> of mr darcy she could not but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago <unk> his <unk> in the affair that proud and <unk> as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had <unk> brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be <unk> or unjust any thing that spoke him of <unk> or <unk> habits	1.4330125702369627
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling	2.2758459260747883
that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible	2.192345972483447
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself	1.4820620191966616
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial <unk> absurd	2.691044170012201
"how <unk> have i acted	1.6361796790056262
"i who have <unk> myself on my discernment	2.14623475807612
i who have valued myself on my abilities	2.0273965863900996
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or <unk> distrust how humiliating is this discovery	2.3296545406215703
yet how just a humiliation	1.4516870031085078
but vanity not love has been my folly	1.8729792134117644
pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned	2.6826957952797255
till this moment i never knew myself	1.8935723813977055
from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy's explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again	2.761699813343848
widely different was the effect of a second perusal	2.0563761646169056
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other	2.7964263510937144
he declared himself to have been totally <unk> of her sister's attachment and she could not help remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been	3.291196513222055
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane	2.067952213571742
she felt that jane's feelings though <unk> were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility	2.8278465644316357
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe	3.0403942274525204
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers	2.1187853261287715
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt	3.211950837613714
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining <unk> and <unk> herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of <unk> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	1.566048452832833
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found	1.8738174228603839
elizabeth could but just affect concern in <unk> him she really rejoiced at it	2.3198078145551047
she could think only of her letter	2.414664881335013
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting <unk> was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings	1.8139306939110624
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyship's indignation would have been	2.2758459260747883
"what would she have said	1.4856802413634995
how would she have behaved	1.4911872970042281
were questions with which she amused herself	1.7956221365880658
"i assure you i feel it exceedingly " said lady catherine "i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do	2.7812525655375624
but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me	3.057378125474488
they were excessively sorry to go	1.5479809399581075
but so they always are	1.5294941759956557
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year	2.359863785104499
his attachment to rosings certainly <unk>	2.15295143824875
mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	2.624261757994834
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added "but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer	1.8957356524063758
mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure	2.3363155824470807
"i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation " replied elizabeth "but it is not in my power to accept it	2.7447590736572973
i must be in town next saturday	2.540870874305027
"why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks	2.3366656537759107
i told mrs collins so before you came	1.9882492708980022
there can be no occasion for your going so soon	1.949576704583707
mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight	2.284498708356107
"but my father cannot	1.3892673096167087
he wrote last week to hurry my return	1.7490741904283826
your father of course may spare you if your mother can	2.099002942246668
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father	2.2709985314299903
and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as <unk> does not object to the <unk> <unk> there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large	1.5483652565854986
lady catherine seemed resigned	1.72892886323431
"mrs collins you must send a servant with them	2.1239754267487965
you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves	2.9334414581573687
it is highly improper	1.2253075845586736
you must contrive to send somebody	1.5808772960384128
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing	2.920875732746786
young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life	1.9290184995139255
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her	2.4292951478492166
miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner	3.0830698253206217
i am excessively attentive to all those things	1.8289363234568983
you must send <unk> with the young ladies mrs collins	2.8441534776057646
"my uncle is to send a servant for us	2.1319334443704574
he keeps a man servant does he	1.7081925654682872
i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things	2.2630406777591956
if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to	2.4128627575108705
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was	2.192345972483447
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections	2.2758459260747883
mr darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart	2.841155650165761
she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different	2.2505251230358776
when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and <unk> him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion	2.321954250288982
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment <unk> her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	2.7605793213494363
they were hopeless of remedy	1.3894113648272806
her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild <unk> of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil	2.610157215682537
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence what chance could there be of improvement	2.654474043504224
catherine weak <unk> irritable and completely under lydia's guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia self <unk> and careless would scarcely give them a hearing	2.365506572686099
they were ignorant idle and vain	1.5549289949464296
while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever	2.859387034520471
anxiety on jane's behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcy's explanation by <unk> bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the <unk> of his confidence in his friend	1.8329807108324359
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	2.232735148777284
when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both	2.321954250288982
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <unk> <unk> necessary	2.942727176209282
"i know not miss elizabeth " said he "whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it	2.3713737056616555
the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you	2.0921868350981767
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode	2.342316484817518
our plain manner of living our small rooms and few <unk> and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time <unk>	1.8139306939110624
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged	2.7710591490831655
mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied "it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not <unk>	3.1324302000646673
we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome	1.968419447286612
in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one <unk> in it an object of compassion while they are <unk> of our intimacy at rosings	2.610157215682537
"you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin	2.3806289141093044
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so	3.598590985381804
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent	2.321954250288982
only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage	2.652732802014001
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking	2.8229319233291688
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us	2.2721439917227126
we seem to have been designed for each other	2.170887680720895
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she <unk> believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	2.7799837365290703
she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they <unk>	2.968418647316559
it was melancholy to leave her to such society	2.223799013149947
her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their <unk> concerns had not yet lost their charms	2.817850416602704
at length the chaise arrived the <unk> were <unk> on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready	3.060913365888466
after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was <unk> her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner though unknown	1.7782794100389228
he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some <unk> that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings	2.4244620170823286
elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off	3.093288356186085
cried maria after a few minutes silence "it seems but a day or two since we first came	2.515049732460753
"a great many indeed " said her companion with a sigh	2.674663246671835
"we have dined nine times at rosings besides <unk> tea there twice	1.8864676929282935
how much i shall have to tell	1.6538992055963873
elizabeth privately added "and how much i shall have to conceal	1.978525241865502
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiner's house where they were to remain a few days	2.7261943957777843
but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	3.1989804581186396
to know that she had the power of <unk> what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have <unk> but the state of <unk> in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther	1.4556047973707602
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the <unk> inn where mr bennet's carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in <unk> of the <unk> punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs	1.7455628235338618
these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite <unk> watching the <unk> on guard and dressing a <unk> and <unk>	2.5413289692949617
after <unk> their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <unk> usually <unk> exclaiming "is not this nice	2.3547925092423387
is not this an agreeable surprise	1.6211374248604569
"and we mean to treat you all " added lydia "but you must <unk> us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there	2.5424809180743395
then shewing her purchases <unk> here i have bought this bonnet	2.0380833760440935
i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not	3.618357311872189
i shall <unk> it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better	3.2101853112177006
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern "oh	2.3108621390601205
but there were two or three much <unk> in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to <unk> it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable	2.942727176209282
besides it will not much signify what one <unk> this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight	2.7876134590811157
"they are going to be <unk> near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer	2.9998167805828784
it would be such a <unk> scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all	3.3813221224998253
mamma would like to go too of all things	2.172623276475826
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have	2.0377699563764895
"yes " thought elizabeth " that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once	2.8381100411094797
"now i have got some news for you " said lydia as they sat down to table	2.3206724241203935
"what do you think	1.7336058471134754
it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like	2.20287580224904
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay	2.68789509432038
you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared	2.468605350498642
i dare say he often <unk> worse things said than i am going to say	2.634819694305575
but he is an ugly fellow	2.1306377302465678
i am glad he is gone	1.8296388360870621
i never saw such a long <unk> in my life	2.4152142417199953
well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it	2.438594081976248
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king	2.4150878447881863
she is gone down to her uncle at <unk> gone to stay	2.5705402310923327
added elizabeth <unk> from a connection imprudent as to fortune	2.372349424295295
"she is a great fool for going away if she liked him	2.683558534461592
"but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side " said jane	2.351516048867034
"i am sure there is not on his	3.1050360030742743
i will answer for it he never cared three <unk> about her	2.3510703549856165
elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly <unk> and fancied liberal	2.586200562333263
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their <unk> <unk> and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases were seated in it	2.2758459260747883
"how <unk> we are <unk> in	1.819724855823963
well now let us be quite comfortable and <unk> and talk and laugh all the way home	2.543547858494906
have you had any flirting	1.7002247432302615
jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare	2.1393803244867695
she is almost three and twenty	1.4014563549098948
lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty	2.4772825047918703
she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it	3.0292630826779994
how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would <unk> you about to all the balls	3.644410529023645
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel <unk>	2.489376957371516
kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends	3.046989570903508
and so she asked the two <unk> to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did	2.848332152092508
we dressed up <unk> in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun	2.405028246838792
when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord	3.288242217660782
and so did mrs forster	1.3810288848189498
i thought i should have died	2.0950079259031997
and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter	2.633325203339613
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no <unk> the frequent mention of wickham's name	3.1445825507604193
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in <unk> beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth "i am glad you are come back lizzy	2.6078518328753666
their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was <unk> engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other <unk> them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather <unk> than any other person's was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	1.3768571648527583
as we went along kitty and me drew up all the <unk> and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the <unk> cold <unk> in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too	1.5848931924611136
and then when we came away it was such fun	2.30542143779303
i thought we never should have got into the coach	2.0761230905617665
and then we were so merry all the way home	2.1991853610310144
to this mary very gravely replied <unk> be it from me my dear sister to <unk> such pleasures	2.595132620440257
they would doubtless be <unk> with the generality of female minds	2.3833930862220227
i should infinitely prefer a book	1.4906950196349553
but of this answer lydia heard not a word	1.8167780141019103
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all	2.454134953753636
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme	2.8038916108950214
it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	3.4750096637050807
she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	2.5181077177763718
the comfort to her of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression	2.2826594760269523
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents	2.848035868435802
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his <unk> were at the same time so vague and <unk> that her mother though often <unk> had never yet despaired of succeeding at last chapter xvii	2.321954250288982
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself	1.968419447286612
miss bennet's astonishment was soon <unk> by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	2.6165396563526944
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him	2.543345761304649
"his being so sure of succeeding was wrong " said she "and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment	2.574327033562009
"indeed " replied elizabeth "i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me	2.715932473738375
you do not blame me however for refusing him	2.6931747229576235
"but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham	1.9876752854613355
what a stroke was this for poor jane	1.7633281118534212
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole <unk> of <unk> as was here collected in one individual	2.841035938826108
nor was darcy's vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery	2.3300199905928425
"this will not do " said elizabeth	2.236521797357502
"you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing	2.4817793670991994
take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one	2.5498121321706786
there is but such a <unk> of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been <unk> about pretty much	3.290344562312668
for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy's but you shall do as you chuse	2.518196314674378
it was some time however before a smile could be <unk> from jane	2.573629333153541
"i do not know when i have been more shocked " said she	3.242399985369325
"wickham so very bad	1.3965625971068767
it is almost past belief	1.445244946434014
dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered	2.0870975298443883
and having to relate such a thing of his sister	2.302015154358753
it is really too distressing	1.4446399669214463
i am sure you must feel it so	2.4374100710977733
no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both	2.3124077444090667
i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	2.6895975905909575
<unk> wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance	2.4692678730959297
"there certainly was some great <unk> in the education of those two young men	2.858569477532129
one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it	2.634550275726442
it is such a <unk> to one's genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	3.0878342039030935
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <unk> on something <unk>	2.621456457568433
"lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now	2.9841384509217534
"indeed i could not	1.1483816421401196
and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had	2.6826957952797255
how i wanted you	1.2230147326883862
"how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly <unk>	2.7673981087115602
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging	2.669399588223186
i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character	2.973647284640949
miss bennet paused a little and then replied <unk> there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully	2.404839778428111
what is your own opinion	1.8757319739429417
"that it ought not to be attempted	2.463995674653803
mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public	2.5165143551650426
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to <unk> people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me	2.4816289228368253
i am not equal to it	3.022623602397633
wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is	2.498046768266559
<unk> <unk> it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before	2.7950234331918438
at present i will say nothing about it	1.7004231420179237
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character	2.3382094817695362
we must not make him desperate	2.5169363084024843
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was <unk> by this conversation	2.8899816538361187
she had got rid of two of the <unk> which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either	2.6826957952797255
but there was still something <unk> behind of which prudence <unk> the <unk>	2.4599962880111153
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy's letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend	3.1977225148807724
here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <unk> of <unk>	2.7396532195175336
"and then " said she "if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself	2.7562282679151764
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value	2.3979329251606685
she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits	3.08648190282465
jane was not happy	1.6755731695660538
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley	1.887212620948938
having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater <unk> than first <unk> often boast and so <unk> did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were <unk> to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity	1.53174046370208
"well lizzy " said mrs bennet one day "what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane's	2.687650324281304
for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody	2.604560604012152
i told my sister philips so the other day	2.0539111099263216
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london	2.8978886333807523
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know	3.2435296955856003
"i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	2.887555517444566
nobody wants him to come	1.5678738412113353
well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done	2.712520075216993
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer	2.3833618656128577
well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep	2.5793950915164783
charlotte is an excellent <unk> i dare say	1.8071836923508782
if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough	2.4145994826322204
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say	2.0576329706295566
"no nothing at all	1.0355423009917522
"a great deal of good management depend upon it	1.8133265556886577
they will never be distressed for money	1.928707097457597
well much good may it do them	1.7133362033858721
and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead	2.091691617352538
they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens	2.6995558983740042
"it was a subject which they could not mention before me	2.8479290542418743
but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves	2.1659548009774916
well if they can be easy with an estate that is not <unk> their own so much the better	2.881297775246892
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	3.023540329514639
the first week of their return was soon gone	1.9828394977239727
the dejection was almost universal	1.5011411016571579
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard <unk> in any of the family	2.634192382404948
what is to become of us	1.3185796005949761
what are we to do	1.385910015043492
would they often <unk> in the bitterness of <unk>	2.7184006483330014
their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago	2.5125210415950483
"i am sure " said she "i cried for two days together when colonel <unk> regiment went away	2.490471993337159
i thought i should have broke my heart	2.1162591381800575
"i am sure i shall break mine " said lydia	2.5134127237108497
"if one could but go to brighton	1.2638041834772575
if one could but go to brighton	1.2638041834772575
but papa is so disagreeable	1.5311853239390711
"a little <unk> bathing would set me up for ever	1.8149899186729275
such were the kind of lamentations <unk> perpetually through longbourn house	2.2932642383706003
she felt <unk> the justice of mr darcy's objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend	2.635201328694579
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton	2.536537599047838
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three <unk> acquaintance they had been intimate two	2.9789761688338166
"i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia " said she "though i am not her particular friend	3.361487425734729
i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older	2.7951003518069824
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned	3.073565263021044
as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from <unk> in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death <unk> of all possibility of common sense for the latter and <unk> as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly <unk> her father not to let her go	1.715437896342879
she represented to him all the <unk> of lydia's general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home	1.968419447286612
he heard her attentively and then said "lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances	2.1187853261287715
"if you were aware " said elizabeth "of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair	2.154434690031884
"what has she frightened away some of your lovers	1.9999903760494895
but do not be cast down	2.2895959514080007
such <unk> <unk> as cannot bear to be connected with a little <unk> are not worth a regret	3.0248031765337733
"indeed you are mistaken	1.1147319238506121
i have no such <unk> to resent	2.6278329749203877
it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now <unk>	3.133867273501918
our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild <unk> the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia's character	2.627466018522221
excuse me for i must speak plainly	2.3640630961182345
in this danger kitty is also comprehended	1.7516026510414258
she will follow wherever lydia leads	1.4917349697972615
vain ignorant idle and absolutely <unk>	1.5379162615286093
my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace	2.942727176209282
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply "do not make yourself uneasy my love	2.5613758540640768
wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters	2.848035868435802
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton	2.356994084112989
let her go then	1.612616340040996
colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body	2.6315804652663863
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here	2.6969900680155026
the officers will find women better worth their notice	1.8291920471223844
let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance	2.4361693315114694
at any rate she cannot grow many <unk> worse without <unk> us to <unk> her up for the rest of her life	3.102394322942894
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be <unk> but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry	3.177833414244154
it was not in her nature however to increase her <unk> by dwelling on them	2.621065596447277
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over <unk> evils or <unk> them by anxiety was no part of her disposition	2.4777983449944654
she saw with the <unk> eye of fancy the <unk> of that gay bathing place covered with officers	3.04577482806843
she saw herself the object of attention to <unk> and to <unk> of them at present unknown	4.08647224799264
she saw all the <unk> of the camp its <unk> <unk> forth in <unk> <unk> of lines crowded with the young and the gay and <unk> with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a <unk> tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	2.023589647725157
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such <unk> as these what would have been her sensations	3.2205962996994875
they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same	2.664306927027934
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself	2.8190402500464984
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time	2.7443974069383894
having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the <unk> of former partiality entirely so	2.7718745481035976
she had even learnt to <unk> in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a <unk> to disgust and weary	3.1192477393642806
in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her	2.192345972483447
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	1.7301957388458942
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr darcy's having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	1.5848931924611136
her answer was warmly in his favour	1.6664244513737556
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added "how long did you say that he was at rosings	3.0327794463639837
"and you saw him frequently	1.5780284460937237
"yes almost every day	1.1349638525782144
"his manners are very different from his cousin's	2.2341821779391315
but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance	2.1711479732985683
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her	2.5194139815293495
but checking himself he added in a <unk> tone "is it in address that he improves	2.802431024673906
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style	2.086636194053047
for i dare not hope " he continued in a lower and more serious tone "that he is improved in essentials	2.5629698845984854
while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning	2.4295246422906476
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the <unk> of accents "you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right	1.6744824380115346
his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must <unk> him from such <unk> misconduct as i have suffered by	2.954308711833871
i only fear that the sort of <unk> to which you i imagine have been <unk> is merely <unk> on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe	2.610157215682537
his fear of her has always <unk> i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <unk> the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart	2.2758459260747883
elizabeth could not <unk> a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head	2.7007460730884056
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him	2.914012810148204
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	2.3713737056616555
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning	2.617782104638388
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than <unk>	2.3735029703408066
kitty was the only one who <unk> tears but she did <unk> from vexation and envy	2.6721301832221833
mrs bennet was <unk> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and <unk> in her <unk> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the <unk> happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	1.6618362775387496
respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown	2.307956953247371
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	2.4816289228368253
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had <unk> to his amusement	3.1740652015662416
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true <unk> will derive benefit from such as are given	2.4816289228368253
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband	2.520396211283654
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of <unk> the mind of his wife	1.7301957388458942
their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant <unk> at the <unk> of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time <unk> her natural degree of sense since the <unk> of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be <unk> was likely to be <unk> in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a <unk> place and a camp	1.4556047973707602
upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself	2.543345761304649
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of <unk> console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment	2.085205857248754
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the <unk> of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	1.9952623149688797
"but it is fortunate " thought she "that i have something to wish for	2.6997465573654504
but here by carrying with me one <unk> source of regret in my sister's absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure <unk>	2.459466134685948
a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only <unk> off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation	2.53523415193434
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short	2.6657220506778123
those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	1.3650078065460138
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn	2.563025058579799
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose	2.6409639986227504
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and <unk> a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire	1.4677992676220695
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	3.352856775136015
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock <unk> <unk> or the <unk>	2.232735148777284
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough	2.608349962891796
but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again	3.1958639449733077
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected	2.2295370630389106
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner	2.939439101744349
"but surely " said she "i may enter his county with <unk> and rob it of a few <unk> <unk> without his perceiving me	2.8393723579795376
the period of expectation was now <unk>	2.017824848723707
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival	2.5027566059726634
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement	2.7840844874349293
one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to <unk> every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were <unk> abroad	2.4244620170823286
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> c	2.848035868435802
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern	2.1733154280270526
to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiner's former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated	1.9187520990478337
it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it	2.868078285331319
mr gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation	2.4418581055354975
"a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected	2.4181151711529565
wickham passed all his youth there you know	1.8518484430924143
she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	3.0735588090656836
she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine <unk> or satin <unk>	2.6650841713331705
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity	1.3487444625805314
"if it were merely a fine house <unk> <unk> " said she "i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful	2.844078778384114
they have some of the finest woods in the country	2.974217926650133
the possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred	2.2421765921517003
she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk	2.6929512372998285
but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last <unk> if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were <unk> answered	3.046989570903508
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer	2.4816289228368253
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her <unk> being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme	1.701254279852589
to pemberley therefore they were to go	1.7752071689609465

elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter	2.6072494924391947
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground	1.949278428242048
they entered it in one of its <unk> points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood <unk> over a wide extent	2.6365099127080116
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view	2.394922417129311
they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the <unk> of a considerable <unk> where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound	2.085205857248754
it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and <unk> by a <unk> of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was <unk> into greater but without any <unk> appearance	2.4244620170823286
its banks were neither formal nor <unk> adorned	1.9776379527625896
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste	2.706577952770574
they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something	3.007077435047318
the housekeeper came a respectable looking <unk> woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her	2.3684924981256734
they followed her into the dining parlour	2.0520793653020766
it was a large well <unk> room handsomely fitted up	2.429703783313105
the hill <unk> with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object	2.3363040068149017
as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different <unk> but from every window there were beauties to be seen	2.270406330366525
the rooms were <unk> and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither <unk> nor <unk> fine with less of <unk> and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	2.154434690031884
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted	2.047580641655337
but no " recollecting herself "that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them	3.221141241321865
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it	2.553032861344177
at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds replied that he was adding "but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends	2.610157215682537
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day	2.3192690933013282
her aunt now called her to look at a picture	2.359829962640637
she approached and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece	2.253949639257045
her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it	1.8791855568905418
"he is now gone into the army " she added "but i am afraid he has turned out very wild	2.5620257986932105
"and that " said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures "is my master and very like him	2.635587603162301
it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago	2.3371373287352046
"i have heard much of your master's fine person " said mrs gardiner looking at the picture "it is a handsome face	3.0221460218677283
but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not	2.3218483452837826
mrs <unk> respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this <unk> of her knowing her master	2.8558943196472146
"does that young lady know mr darcy	1.7189068718962364
elizabeth coloured and said "a little	1.794564534656129
"and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma'am	2.853349240788337
"i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this	2.7522877516098196
this room was my late master's favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then	2.418299872519496
he was very fond of them	2.162678700123456
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham's being among them	2.2330159776354184
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old	2.7874581536874516
"and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother	2.2896332305134925
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished	2.0596125959192713
she <unk> and <unk> all day long	3.0441508726862603
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him	2.5954371700409906
mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her <unk> by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister	2.678728369377042
"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year	1.9862092966773435
"not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months	2.95130581871624
<unk> " thought elizabeth "when she goes to ramsgate	2.2685667225080373
"yes sir but i do not know when that will be	2.4277093588417338
i do not know who is good enough for him	2.437820491746175
elizabeth could not help saying "it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so	3.633756194941804
"i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him " replied the other	2.661413227276951
that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion	3.0006106125375314
her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying "there are very few people of whom so much can be said	2.6982181755478645
you are lucky in having such a master	1.8511931201362213
"yes sir i know i am	1.8152550024311531
if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better	3.4750684022510323
elizabeth almost stared at her	1.3220322893285485
"can this be mr darcy	1.2920027880732963
"his father was an excellent man " said mrs gardiner	2.1289291771722976
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more	1.8916526641166937
mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point	1.966357126084842
she related the subject of the <unk> the <unk> of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain	3.60319015209562
"he is the best landlord and the best master " said she "that ever lived	2.7919734707174797
not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves	2.326206156541111
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name	3.112440015839844
some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it	2.677992973626525
to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men	2.5591465711856345
"in what an amiable light does this place him	1.9140486014655698
"this fine account of him " <unk> her aunt as they walked "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend	2.963280907556823
"that is not very likely our authority was too good	2.295720950039823
on reaching the <unk> <unk> above they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and <unk> than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley	1.8957356524063758
"he is certainly a good brother " said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows	3.1745778017302904
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight when she should enter the room	2.0185459140400135
"and this is always the way with him " she added	2.0891760305854357
"whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment	2.6537005881566818
there is nothing he would not do for her	2.823234384076032
the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shewn	2.437226534409212
in the former were many good <unk> but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some <unk> of miss darcy's in <unk> whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible	2.085205857248754
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger	2.708120383919945
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her	2.3443194646533545
at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her	2.848035868435802
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery	2.36414937324586
mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's life time	2.5348919330553774
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature	2.284996179097644
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant	2.1812396845519904
as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship	2.378718493651949
how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow	2.8294279265426123
how much of good or evil must be done by him	2.263939164479153
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the <unk> on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression	1.7782794100389228
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were <unk> over to the <unk> who met them at the hall door	2.543345761304649
as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the <unk>	1.9429496147158305
they were within twenty <unk> of each other and so <unk> was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight	3.0203393813591983
their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush	2.138758620906156
he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility	2.6826957952797255
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome	2.685668585668164
had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the <unk> expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it	2.2758459260747883
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family	2.4816289228368253
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life	1.9429496147158305
nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual <unk> and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the <unk> of his thoughts	1.8738174228603839
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave	2.522874670165855
the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence	2.527996304191484
she was overpowered by shame and vexation	1.437599139221179
how strange must it appear to him	1.6849198296545398
why did she come	1.396869045561474
had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his <unk> for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment <unk> from his horse or his carriage	2.610157215682537
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting	2.2273087775642817
and his behaviour so <unk> altered what could it mean	2.0840445488516997
but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family	2.3308667545852857
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	2.5390810124771175
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in <unk> park when he put his letter into her hand	2.4752584964874993
she knew not what to think nor how to account for it	2.2994118598297684
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was	2.664202803243537
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him	2.848035868435802
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease	3.1145549198652334
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure	3.224312842268012
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <unk> were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods <unk> many and occasionally part of the stream	1.8139306939110624
mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk	2.4914126634736053
they crossed it by a <unk> bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a <unk> allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the <unk> <unk> wood which bordered it	1.8957356524063758
her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some <unk> in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little	1.5947870582948211
whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching them and at no great distance	2.543345761304649
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met	2.680215966274446
elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them	2.562473179795398
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them	2.220879295362034
with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to <unk> his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words <unk> " and <unk> " when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be <unk> <unk>	1.7455628235338618
her colour changed and she said no more	1.956456021035856
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	2.913604999413298
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite <unk> and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had <unk> in his offer to herself	2.232735148777284
"what will be his surprise " thought she "when he knows who they are	2.3144572595785684
he takes them now for people of fashion	1.8175452738434916
that he was surprised by the <unk> was evident he <unk> it however with <unk> and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner	2.942727176209282
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph	2.92602530590978
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush	2.888758551177872
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and <unk> in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners	2.953343089611215
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing <unk> and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport	1.8529220216409523
mrs gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder	2.475388554690295
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself	2.389237863407294
her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating "why is he so altered	2.15099971662338
from what can it proceed	1.6032455182682943
it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened	2.7605302414823436
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this	2.1413845322927942
it is impossible that he should still love me	2.8183412966429224
after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on <unk> their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water <unk> there <unk> to be a little alteration	2.192345972483447
it originated in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth's arm <unk> to her support and consequently preferred her husband's	2.8285189138671756
after a short silence the lady first spoke	1.9739039564501142
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected "for your housekeeper " she added <unk> us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left <unk> we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country	1.6876124757881479
"they will join me early to morrow " he continued "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters	2.4552849894956243
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow	1.3916987937311978
"there is also one other person in the party " he continued after a pause "who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton	2.1187853261287715
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her	2.1187853261287715
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought	1.835090791272345
elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased	2.7768716599855727
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind	3.1831784341459493
he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn	2.539409958570437
she wanted to talk but there seemed an <unk> on every subject	2.69852824864662
yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over	2.2986362300858922
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house	2.4232405317101997
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	2.8212459025623784
"he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming " said her uncle	2.175459512439077
"there is something a little stately in him to be sure " replied her aunt "but it is confined to his air and is not <unk>	3.2102522747112645
i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it	2.417993667511246
"i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us	2.1009248967999876
it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention	2.9569442010583895
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning	2.761699813343848
"but perhaps he may be a little <unk> in his civilities " replied her uncle	3.3343287452877557
"your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds	2.633441727395405
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing	2.5957089226262515
"from what we have seen of him " continued mrs gardiner "i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham	2.543345761304649
he has not an ill natured look	2.1596126487898277
and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart	3.007222609668922
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes	1.794742088137819
but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant <unk> every virtue	3.049114074623404
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different <unk> and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham's so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire	1.6265507027536246
in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually <unk> her authority but stating it to be such as might be <unk> on	2.6826957952797255
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its <unk> to think of any thing else	1.9429496147158305
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	2.4244620170823286
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came	2.414284801483581
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street	1.8957356524063758
elizabeth immediately <unk> the livery guessed what it meant and <unk> no small degree of surprise to her relations by <unk> them with the honour which she expected	2.641341455324032
her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business	2.4244620170823286
nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece	2.8134869996430156
while these <unk> born notions were passing in their <unk> the perturbation of elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing	2.2078656219215533
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of <unk> she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than <unk> anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	2.053525026457146
she <unk> from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	2.4816289228368253
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place	2.4072596483660855
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	2.578701560788672
since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy	3.137068032481541
she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle	2.8935473153213764
elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by <unk> such different feelings	3.0883240282000415
all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again	2.610157215682537
he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done	3.037035185003154
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting <unk> than to herself	2.4931505471596105
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention	2.4373439036395457
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love	2.154434690031884
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was <unk> with admiration was evident enough	2.454373304784482
elizabeth on her side had much to do	2.2370635384813387
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were <unk> in her favour	1.8738174228603839
bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased	2.1034428850558586
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh	3.138588969964346
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner	2.628156979025679
sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance	2.5926107453897957
but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a <unk> of jane	3.433320018281994
on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious <unk> denoted a recollection of jane not <unk> by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared	2.053525026457146
he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her " and before she could reply he added "it is above eight months	1.9429496147158305
we have not met since the th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield	2.245867430959193
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when <unk> to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn	2.8549105129486723
there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning	3.2559862911809936
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however <unk> its existence might prove had at least <unk> one day	1.6050163175336876
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and <unk> the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible	1.53174046370208
never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or <unk> reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings	1.5947870582948211
their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country	2.1187853261287715
miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <unk> readily obeyed	2.753260957412323
mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head	2.717813299354006
presuming however that this studied <unk> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on	2.023589647725157
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends	2.987579190739482
elizabeth <unk> all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little	1.8957356524063758
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner's curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication	3.431534663692283
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her	3.046989570903508
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find	3.380829066727121
they could not be <unk> by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have <unk> it for mr darcy	2.1187853261287715
there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners <unk> respectability was not to be hastily rejected	2.232735148777284
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight	2.409915515752868
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit	2.6683508301450494
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	2.67640300964102
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were <unk> understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged	1.8329807108324359
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out	2.023589647725157
she certainly did not hate him	1.50701506506463
no <unk> had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called	2.8827251534005245
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be <unk> to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a <unk> nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced	1.79571449437164
gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the <unk> and <unk> of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection	2.610157215682537
he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest <unk> seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any <unk> display of regard or any <unk> of manner where their two <unk> only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister	1.7782794100389228
such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love <unk> love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means <unk> though it could not be exactly defined	1.968419447286612
she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	1.6876124757881479
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy's in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be <unk> though it could not be <unk> by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning	1.5570684047537309
elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply	2.481636830256219
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed	1.9952623149688797
on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer	2.5658403028327514
its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful <unk> and <unk> <unk> which were scattered over the <unk> lawn	2.761699813343848
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london	2.791924318710227
georgiana's reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved	2.321954250288982
mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her	2.330869939300202
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments	2.4937142670226917
it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on	2.023589647725157
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard	2.8602820818706647
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself <unk> watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention	3.433320018281994
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much	2.610157215682537
her own thoughts were <unk> her	1.7299693203702469
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room	2.251150873896298
she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine	2.46601447748577
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley's voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	2.4463989449780263
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of <unk> whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to <unk> she began to regret that he came	1.9187520990478337
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on <unk> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning	2.232735148777284
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	1.715437896342879
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over	2.023589647725157
miss darcy on her brother's entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side	2.3713737056616555
miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with <unk> civility "pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton	2.8598189501200646
they must be a great loss to your family	2.231926040294775
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was <unk> in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress but <unk> herself <unk> to <unk> the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	1.9429496147158305
while she spoke an <unk> glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes	2.5313904765199777
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have <unk> from the hint but she had merely intended to <unk> elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps	1.539926526059492
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement	2.2916723433228054
to no creature had it been revealed where <unk> was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own	2.154434690031884
he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend	2.3713737056616555
elizabeth's collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more	2.561303611807473
her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully	2.3713737056616555
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was <unk> her feelings in <unk> on elizabeth's person behaviour and dress	2.543345761304649
but georgiana would not join her	1.5991784744127322
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable	2.4816289228368253
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy " she cried "i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	2.8049726155088575
she is grown so <unk> and <unk>	1.7538123937765806
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again	2.761158598461068
her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome	2.275780649778055
her <unk> wants character there is nothing marked in its lines	2.2937701388731866
her <unk> are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them	2.942727176209282
they have a sharp <unk> look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self <unk> without fashion which is intolerable	3.2423852012999914
he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued "i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield ' she a beauty	1.8529220216409523
i should as soon call her mother a wit	1.9705500420116182
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time	2.37406281056152
"yes " replied darcy who could contain himself no longer "but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	2.4816289228368253
he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	3.123780737148513
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both	2.557197551168038
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had <unk> engaged their attention	2.7212301273460837
they talked of his sister his friends his house his <unk> of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject	2.2758459260747883
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere	1.6265507027536246
elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill	2.6249172861177876
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves	2.660307985056482
the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago	2.252289424454509
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence	2.4816289228368253
it was to this effect "since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well	2.6826957952797255
what i have to say relates to poor lydia	2.1343866510300424
an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham	2.4244620170823286
to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected	2.268268290058086
i am very very sorry	2.2082539120143614
so imprudent a match on both sides	1.5169323995198853
but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood	2.874431246911672
thoughtless and <unk> i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart	2.8670735221367987
his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing	2.4983064561381356
our poor mother is sadly grieved	1.6239110591201695
my father bears it better	1.348260968919751
they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight	2.126165474694771
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon	1.980885618078977
lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention	2.438769633777307
i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother	2.363477560088093
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written	3.05137793923467
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on <unk> this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first "by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so <unk> that i cannot answer for being <unk>	1.53174046370208
dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed	2.784778025479415
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland	2.4244620170823286
colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express	2.5853350307935683
though lydia's short letter to mrs f	1.8475322290132044
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w	2.7506019937301156
never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f	2.5979176680497997
who instantly taking the alarm set off from b	1.8026176601472397
intending to trace their route	1.4216747247379453
he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom	2.2692568283828076
all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road	2.865565837397477
i know not what to think	1.439179024993482
after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f	1.9920402234787469
came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the <unk> and at the <unk> in barnet and <unk> but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through	2.942727176209282
with the <unk> concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart	3.3967058835518933
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f	2.362876702347983
but no one can throw any blame on them	2.1273587608220783
our distress my dear lizzy is very great	2.315739165250531
my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him	2.2281047730762933
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing	1.9952623149688797
i grieve to find however that colonel f	1.9642274647982187
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w	2.435912734869524
was not a man to be trusted	2.5789924135812816
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room	2.0978646965125938
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder	2.758244883616399
i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return	2.8323610867021896
i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient	2.7411535071765774
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former	2.9878589349122238
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her	2.31305632126037
what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and <unk> way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening	2.2758459260747883
in such an <unk> my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i <unk> upon his goodness	3.010513006711505
where where is my uncle	1.5789513650427263
her pale face and <unk> manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was <unk> by lydia's situation hastily exclaimed "i beg your pardon but i must leave you	2.3713737056616555
i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose	2.547514833820947
what is the matter	1.8011076395370633
cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself "i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner	2.417937625491418
you are not well enough you cannot go yourself	2.496121836684601
elizabeth hesitated but her <unk> <unk> under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	2.7566531378706287
calling back the servant therefore she <unk> him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost <unk> to fetch his master and mistress home instantly	2.568010328937429
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so <unk> ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and <unk> "let me call your maid	2.232735148777284
is there nothing you could take to give you present relief	2.3114257560322358
you are very ill	1.6158691562810037
"no i thank you " she replied endeavouring to recover herself	2.547742602313773
"there is nothing the matter with me	1.6255919207585143
i am quite well	1.6446295365082695
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	2.6955850339633587
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word	2.753476889315362
darcy in wretched suspense could only say something <unk> of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence	2.7103968292568332
"i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news	2.428805776653418
my youngest sister has left all her friends has <unk> has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham	2.495474630313544
they are gone off together from brighton	1.9388273151532918
you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever	2.4390792491901707
darcy was fixed in astonishment	1.5464615033836384
i who knew what he was	1.709268384135266
had his character been known this could not have happened	2.0902281298413543
but it is all all too late now	2.799811308378713
"i am grieved indeed " cried darcy <unk> shocked	2.1712858337333842
but is it certain absolutely certain	1.5979325590751876
they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland	2.3562855044335196
"and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her	2.0898698764634895
"my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour	2.5806328656615896
but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done	2.0315762818136567
how is such a man to be worked on	2.0624905798871214
how are they even to be discovered	1.8219405131423687
i have not the smallest hope	2.4827119652977316
it is every way <unk>	1.3888238991450066
darcy shook his head in silent <unk>	1.8901832238225613
"when my eyes were opened to his real character	1.8207442398984046
but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much	2.546608259385755
darcy made no answer	1.0199009773522607
he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest <unk> his <unk> contracted his air gloomy	2.793807347744047
elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it	1.6333062185274592
her power was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace	2.2455791613628513
she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing <unk> to her <unk> afforded no <unk> of her distress	3.129669852980172
it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain	2.6826957952797255
but self though it would intrude could not <unk> her	2.3117942875618764
lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon <unk> up every private care and covering her face with her <unk> elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern	1.4440241885954521
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress	2.289305449897522
be so kind as to <unk> for us to miss darcy	2.456089808201496
say that urgent business <unk> us home immediately	1.789802210112636
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible	2.129511546282284
i know it cannot be long	2.453298616107966
he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away	2.2758459260747883
if gratitude and esteem are good <unk> of affection elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty	2.3681353843945194
be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business	2.602993101692827
never since reading jane's second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her	2.2121021995691987
no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation	2.763010941143499
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible	2.232735148777284
but now it was all too natural	2.5330919745687535
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey	1.968419447286612
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion	2.3692874857387345
her affections had been continually <unk> but never without an object	2.042074136061643
how acutely did she now feel it	1.734014270442834
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but <unk> them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with <unk> energy	1.9429496147158305
not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power	2.665487365797689
elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being <unk> by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled	2.4804467167413997
they were to be off as soon as possible	3.1412658083780385
that is all settled	1.6884501110112307
"that is all settled " repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare	2.617264332649957
but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour	2.477772620305029
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were <unk> to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure	1.79571449437164
an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a <unk> space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn	1.8139306939110624
"i have been thinking it over again elizabeth " said her uncle as they drove from the town "and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter	2.321954250288982
it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means <unk> or <unk> and who was actually staying in his <unk> family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward	1.8738174228603839
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster	2.1739963397306585
his temptation is not <unk> to the risk	3.188859629209805
"do you really think so	1.4864685087242249
cried elizabeth <unk> up for a moment	1.9418484035122148
"upon my word " said mrs gardiner "i begin to be of your uncle's opinion	2.8109518227105914
it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it	2.5682587118048437
i cannot think so very ill of wickham	1.931828750506886
can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it	2.0646506901086012
"not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable	2.234175826990177
if indeed it should be so	1.7973836695844183
but i dare not hope it	1.8836737027379526
why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case	2.6316617709196515
"in the first place " replied mr gardiner "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland	2.4079556902668497
"well then supposing them to be in london	1.9303371829579485
they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more <unk> purpose	2.679455022106117
it is not likely that money should be very <unk> on either side and it might strike them that they could be more <unk> though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland	2.848035868435802
"but why all this secrecy	1.6891996599148926
why any fear of detection	1.5227336031275702
why must their marriage be private	1.619548227254879
no no this is not likely	1.8476652040442412
his most particular friend you see by jane's account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her	2.3074788762785805
wickham will never marry a woman without some money	2.1070403833925706
he cannot afford it	1.2076808888829869
and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake <unk> every chance of <unk> himself by marrying well	2.5554522578876853
but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good	2.9686110357243765
lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father's behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter	1.8329807108324359
"but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage	2.891749085339598
"it does seem and it is most shocking indeed " replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt	2.7338363385651774
but really i know not what to say	1.8173001809213696
perhaps i am not doing her justice	2.6820070291648004
but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity	2.610157215682537
she has been allowed to <unk> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	3.3089178355313558
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it	3.2790277706450985
<unk> to her feelings which are naturally lively enough	2.4633526596721524
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can <unk> a woman	2.530098307312999
"but you see that jane " said her aunt "does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt	2.8301477542116293
"of whom does jane ever think ill	1.6435153659659036
and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them	2.8015196939456595
but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is	2.249708636085266
we both know that he has been <unk> in every sense of the word	3.2525014392353553
that he has neither integrity nor honour	2.2043653222397137
"and do you really know all this	2.104018963940535
cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	2.5364921397011893
"i do indeed " replied elizabeth colouring	2.248927237269685
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his <unk> about the whole pemberley family are endless	3.290344562312668
from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl	2.7350795708397233
yet he knew to the contrary himself	1.9800313026993022
he must know that she was as amiable and <unk> as we have found her	3.6695230448251093
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand	2.59005092828312
that that is the worst of all	2.1107171786778887
and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time	2.6769437059674215
as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown	2.023589647725157
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	2.6287988654759458
that such a consequence as this should <unk> you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts	2.5201149620059886
"when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other	2.5496353505010076
"not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been <unk> you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away	2.4244620170823286
when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were	2.5303244189072727
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey	2.321954250288982
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or <unk>	2.1422299083957363
they <unk> as expeditiously as possible and <unk> one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day	2.4295305198405988
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been <unk> by long expectations	3.6746351273783397
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that <unk> up their faces and displayed itself over their whole <unk> in a variety of <unk> and <unk> was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	1.7455628235338618
elizabeth <unk> out and after giving each of them an hasty <unk> hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment immediately met her	2.503813276390288
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears <unk> the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the <unk>	2.525479719972338
"not yet " replied jane	1.4217952842157295
"is my father in town	1.5308624936267046
"yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word	2.17564992724987
"and have you heard from him often	2.237537055869111
"we have heard only once	1.600959280464654
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in <unk> and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do	3.290344562312668
"and my mother how is she	1.681846956523434
"my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken	2.213679963730769
she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all	2.2264145361517462
she does not yet leave her dressing room	2.250458058029006
mary and kitty thank heaven	1.7206044651871575
how much you must have gone through	2.4400845342051682
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party	2.3713737056616555
jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears	2.2887452933203587
when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give	2.848035868435802
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet <unk> her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their <unk> and perhaps announce the marriage	1.9952623149688797
mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret <unk> against the <unk> conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing	1.7301957388458942
"if i had been able " said she "to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her	2.610157215682537
why did the <unk> ever let her go out of their sight	2.3745718489777468
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after	2.848035868435802
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over <unk> as i always am	3.177244889876398
and now <unk> mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all	2.6453235011472516
the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do	2.9255495106596294
they all exclaimed against such <unk> ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia	2.1187853261287715
it is not quite a week since they left brighton	2.8065257882226002
in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done	1.6050163175336876
my dear brother " replied mrs bennet "that is exactly what i could most wish for	2.2209725405656022
and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry	2.827535116113917
and above all things keep mr bennet from <unk>	1.870641662183051
tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my <unk> and have such <unk> such <unk> all over me such <unk> in my side and pains in my head and such <unk> at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day	1.9429496147158305
and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses	3.006489899099325
oh brother how kind you are	1.4910296571757569
i know you will contrive it all	1.7259045928960461
but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters	1.7455628235338618
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <unk> from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the <unk> and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject	1.5753186734235158
in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before	2.764357520549397
one came from her books and the other from her toilette	2.521177959337896
the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself <unk> in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty	2.085205857248754
as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table "this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of	2.4244620170823286
then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added <unk> as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is <unk> that one false step <unk> her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <unk> than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	1.6050163175336876
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply	2.494091565453586
mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral <unk> from the evil before them	2.581835029021452
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly <unk> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy	2.543345761304649
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful <unk> of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying "but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard	1.968419447286612
give me farther particulars	1.2112549807894952
what did colonel forster say	1.544425370440079
they must have seen them together for ever	2.2240680000829056
i am so grieved for him	1.7427209405371296
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey	2.192345972483447
"and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry	1.9482836379680561
did he know of their intending to go off	2.0922912256556643
had colonel forster seen denny himself	1.636198818480885
"yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it	2.6648200981223815
"and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married	2.776542044610594
"how was it possible that such an idea should enter our <unk>	2.465085516132477
i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right	3.0138161849006435
my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be	2.4295298161332624
she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks	2.9702425730491813
"but not before they went to brighton	1.9036812036691213
"no i believe not	1.3983981847747158
"and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself	2.322144501728831
"i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did	2.7869805334997886
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant	2.319454497777315
and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false	2.620061095477385
"oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened	2.288328902575461
"perhaps it would have been better " replied her sister	2.9532280102771384
"but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable	2.2861795418983775
"could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his wife	2.2680049328516936
"he brought it with him for us to see	2.514220506815753
jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth	2.2247385734651277
these were the contents "my dear harriet "you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed	2.6826957952797255
i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel	2.6826957952797255
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham	2.610157215682537
what a good joke it will be	1.7503962530593526
i can hardly write for laughing	2.024617975468911
pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night	2.297821383018354
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure	2.9818966634134765
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell <unk> to mend a great <unk> in my worked muslin gown before they are <unk> up	2.848035868435802
give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey	2.5119450884265553
"what a letter is this to be written at such a moment	2.422585798383163
but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey	3.1079076411951765
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy	3.2129505864313117
how he must have felt it	2.041416403874384
"i never saw any one so shocked	1.834545877039433
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes	2.35017976045351
my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion	2.5752050039902734
jane " cried elizabeth "was there a servant <unk> to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day	3.017514422278458
"i do not know	1.3985793384992617
i hope there was	1.296951455015326
but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult	2.9089191432727017
my mother was in <unk> and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done	3.046989570903508
but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my <unk>	2.319834317777705
"your attendance upon her has been too much for you	2.30641563016963
you do not look well	2.8112371791070543
that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone	2.9018907722353138
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of <unk> should not be broken in on	2.475578410064065
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me	2.769198703165099
she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her <unk> or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us	2.192345972483447
"she had better have <unk> at home " cried elizabeth "perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one's neighbours	2.7475911467239245
assistance is impossible <unk> <unk>	1.4839804972007975
let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied	2.0111996836616575
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	2.6519787925741958
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham	2.3849362517984005
it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be <unk> he meant to make enquiries at clapham	2.6826957952797255
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain	3.0556985577060503
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a <unk>	1.7615770326037883
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be <unk> to her nieces	3.359431752926308
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom	2.7371978986830876
their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and <unk> them up though as she never came without <unk> some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or <unk> she seldom went away without leaving them more <unk> than she found them	2.023589647725157
all meryton seemed striving to <unk> the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light	2.649157549920019
he was declared to be in debt to every <unk> in the place and his <unk> all honoured with the title of <unk> had been extended into every <unk> family	3.162277660168379
every body declared that he was the <unk> young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always <unk> the appearance of his goodness	3.1195703987433956
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them	1.615598098439874
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street	2.543345761304649
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal <unk> in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings	1.8329807108324359
mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it	2.655529498032609
he added that mr bennet seemed wholly <unk> at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon	2.611305630414807
there was also a postscript to this effect	1.6993083457961293
if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a <unk> as that it might be of essential consequence	2.9712366284921545
at present we have nothing to guide us	2.1345005435239686
colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head	2.8982861976750804
but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person	2.2619719365110846
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved	2.6826957952797255
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years	2.7247255301157014
it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to	2.4816289228368253
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected	2.742378147238597
through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance	2.8126693306507153
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what <unk> his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise	1.8329807108324359
be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely <unk> with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the <unk> kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	2.3713737056616555
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can <unk> so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most <unk> to a <unk> mind	2.6826957952797255
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	3.2775452076948572
and it is the more to be <unk> because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte <unk> me that this <unk> of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an <unk> at so early an age	1.566048452832833
<unk> that may be you are <unk> to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair	2.610157215682537
they agree with me in <unk> that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the <unk> of all the others for who as lady catherine herself <unk> says will connect themselves with such a family	2.4816289228368253
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with <unk> satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace	2.487858550295796
let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to <unk> the fruits of her own <unk> offence	2.4816289228368253
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	2.904962586087277
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living	3.289902237110715
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him	2.7553247793971893
and in the wretched state of his own <unk> there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia's relations for it had just <unk> that he had left <unk> debts behind him to a very considerable amount	2.154434690031884
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton	2.104015419594612
he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable	2.5940887606259135
mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror	2.392646326997594
"this is wholly unexpected	1.27596041994462
mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday	2.871399358729782
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in <unk> intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit	2.192345972483447
when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before	3.1805561663697466
"what is he coming home and without poor lydia	1.9823032293449523
<unk> he will not leave london before he has found them	2.6282991454050615
who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away	2.4863102722505412
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it	2.942727176209282
the coach therefore took them the first <unk> of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn	2.599960199283836
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	2.610157215682537
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley	2.154559775401359
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the <unk> of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better	1.7615770326037883
it would have spared her she thought one <unk> night out of two	2.3024315549919407
when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual <unk> composure	2.673385840437866
it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied "say nothing of that	2.4244620170823286
who should suffer but myself	1.4780723211240625
it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it	2.789756450664564
"you must not be too severe upon yourself " replied elizabeth	2.4608062435916254
human nature is so prone to fall into it	1.9212382280474283
no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame	3.131181969549879
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	2.284205024537883
it will pass away soon enough	1.537382060721013
"do you suppose them to be in london	1.9846650265194454
"yes where else can they be so well concealed	1.924425666857033
"and lydia used to want to go to london " added kitty	2.3897709022751186
then after a short silence he continued "lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind	2.454421635199036
"this is a parade " cried he "which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune	2.412992743953119
"i am not going to run away papa " said kitty fretfully "if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia	2.773700629467308
" you go to brighton	1.2847908285824938
no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village	2.132850156608123
balls will be absolutely <unk> unless you stand up with one of your sisters	2.2758501915661427
kitty who took all these <unk> in a serious light began to <unk>	2.359333977541641
"well well " said he "do not make yourself unhappy	2.472134291288281
if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them	3.091220217131563
two days after mr bennet's return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and <unk> that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet "i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask	1.4806572771858608
"what do you mean hill	1.871175773030054
we have heard nothing from town	1.7212357274795873
"dear madam " cried mrs hill in great astonishment "don't you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner	2.574205936934275
he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter	2.528762451446311
away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech	2.271754593844302
upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	2.553937457111317
"yes i have had a letter from him by express	2.689535094412405
"well and what news does it bring	1.8364245658318852
"what is there of good to be expected	1.9816066972624011
said he taking the letter from his pocket "but perhaps you would like to read it	2.3684686889272943
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	1.8173107771650514
jane now came up	1.2227179343396049
"gracechurch street monday <unk>	1.1722539843338675
"my dear brother "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction	2.631580540553264
soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were	2.5919014636210895
it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both " "then it is as i always hoped " cried jane "they are married	2.754685154976426
elizabeth read on "i have seen them both	1.7988106771833092
they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are	2.232735148777284
all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum	1.9429496147158305
these are <unk> which considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you	2.917018723846494
i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer	2.3958367878837095
the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune	2.4816289228368253
if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement	2.610157215682537
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my <unk> and care	3.3046202505808346
send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write <unk>	2.439290464021966
she comes to us to day	1.8131693879458137
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on	2.7267798115581745
cried elizabeth when she had finished	1.7838186622316212
"wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him " said her sister	2.7334214543646738
"my dear father i congratulate you	1.4828794068299485
"and have you answered the letter	1.8782018762809454
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote	2.1982466093058437
my dear father " she cried "come back and write immediately	2.411953590181933
"let me write for you " said jane "if you dislike the trouble yourself	2.7705811788988197
"i dislike it very much " he replied "but it must be done	2.696506699516432
and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house	1.8846758900868532
"and may i ask	1.154134807029848
said elizabeth "but the terms i suppose must be complied with	2.231303001728606
"and they must marry	1.2925183636157869
yet he is such a man	1.6462915807882268
"yes yes they must marry	1.4421894721115105
there is nothing else to be done	2.5191708330669287
but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him	2.610157215682537
cried jane "what do you mean sir	1.7472477432992384
"i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone	2.476367397854601
his debts to be discharged and something still to remain	1.9149019550734248
it must be my uncle's doings	2.646037334640984
generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself	1.897228735977472
a small sum could not do all this	1.8670174817136813
i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	2.701551809167335
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house	1.8124026149135117
their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room	2.6983400445985413
"and they are really to be married	1.9713999510866589
cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves	2.4185341269138716
and for this we are to be thankful	2.1942344413963375
that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice	2.571837812743479
"i comfort myself with thinking " replied jane "that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her	2.801338309940636
he has children of his own and may have more	2.6216781924419545
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds	1.6293208464404376
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <unk>	2.6410019055451532
their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	2.4200251549052574
by this time she is actually with them	2.244818404563409
what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt	2.0896322084456584
"we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side " said jane "i hope and trust they will yet be happy	2.3655116407255785
his <unk> to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking	3.36967031409383
their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten	2.605888811085879
<unk> conduct has been such " replied elizabeth "as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget	2.4739070558808334
it is useless to talk of it	1.7125352319901994
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened	2.68039796394397
he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied <unk> as you please	2.3438316174147085
"may we take my uncle's letter to read to her	2.0093685343621486
"take whatever you like and get away	1.6871417163962907
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together	2.4278855766792793
after a slight <unk> for good news the letter was read aloud	2.3580972530532223
mrs bennet could hardly contain herself	1.7681428150303142
as soon as jane had read mr gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its <unk>	2.8678762934199984
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been <unk> from alarm and vexation	2.9288192182724098
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	2.2505006014403572
"my dear dear lydia	1.3175391614347212
she cried "this is delightful indeed	1.5460316405539931
i shall see her again	1.3807073678164405
she will be married at sixteen	2.366024911255113
my good kind brother	1.3531926169499773
i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing	2.216425316046074
how i long to see her	1.1386908183495934
and to see dear wickham too	1.6395241391983537
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly	2.163630573704399
stay stay i will go myself	1.9966641362651416
ring the bell kitty for hill	1.787783207806865
i will put on my things in a moment	1.93887890991824
my dear dear lydia	1.1900889035876507
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiner's behaviour laid them all under	2.9001999675516883
"for we must attribute this happy conclusion " she added "in a great measure to his kindness	2.47921222802304
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money	2.794155530805889
"well " cried her mother "it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle	2.7644620399379294
if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents	2.3713737056616555
i am so happy	1.7193839853975352
in a short time i shall have a daughter married	2.615953055869327
how well it <unk>	1.2261748352544686
and she was only sixteen last june	3.045788632600496
my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i can't write so i will <unk> and you write for me	3.3810671933417926
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately	2.268070079728731
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of <unk> muslin and <unk> and would shortly have <unk> some very <unk> orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted	2.2758459260747883
one day's delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual	2.806349222360847
"i will go to meryton " said she "as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips	3.0643740664938024
and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long	2.5165680965730113
an <unk> would do me a great deal of good i am sure	2.279247779238986
girls can i do any thing for you in meryton	2.409357246771034
my dear hill have you heard the good news	2.102204833132588
miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a <unk> of <unk> to make merry at her wedding	3.272532062464679
mrs hill began instantly to express her joy	1.962363680240775
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took <unk> in her own room that she might think with freedom	2.852862240360243
poor lydia's situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful	2.8669277889501394
she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained	2.192345972483447
mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an <unk> sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she <unk> him	2.321954250288982
he now wished it more than ever	1.8702039053052877
had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her	2.595116789528062
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great <unk> to be her husband might then have <unk> in its proper place	3.1670732478703756
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	1.9952623149688797
when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son	2.8964997608723486
this son was to join in <unk> off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for	2.866379981549102
five daughters <unk> entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years after lydia's birth had been certain that he would	2.8530898497615236
this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving	2.6940449356142917
mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their <unk> their income	2.5591746990533313
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children	2.483351109443308
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to <unk> the engagements that had been made for him	2.321954250288982
he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement	3.048771011667244
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence	2.7284391337289278
his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in <unk> business he was quick in its execution	2.804077072280199
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her	2.866651334429939
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy	1.9821213362258345
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the <unk> old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain	1.9187520990478337
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits <unk> high	2.942727176209282
no sentiment of shame gave a <unk> to her triumph	2.786251509732449
the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <unk> of elegant nuptials fine <unk> new carriages and servants	2.154434690031884
<unk> park might do " said she "if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at <unk> if the drawing room were larger but <unk> is too far off	2.7974951041933274
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for <unk> lodge the <unk> are dreadful	3.2286992024631402
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained	2.340195722278489
into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have <unk>	2.2158782537301462
i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn	2.6128388075560323
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a <unk> to buy clothes for his daughter	2.4816289228368253
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion	2.296567943369689
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it	1.8152226694553024
that his anger could be carried to such a point of <unk> resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem <unk> exceeded all that she could believe possible	2.6826957952797255
she had no fear of its <unk> farther through his means	2.8669473381444526
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more <unk> depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's <unk> would have mortified her so much	2.761699813343848
not however from any fear of disadvantage from it <unk> to herself for at any rate there seemed a <unk> <unk> between them	2.9554762377350317
had lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <unk>	1.9952623149688797
the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a <unk> as this	3.005530371812602
she was humbled she was grieved she <unk> though she hardly knew of what	2.2978380558850025
she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it	2.70411784167451
she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence	2.8266847768680465
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet	3.3427909774081517
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had <unk> <unk> only four months ago would now have been <unk> and gratefully received	2.942727176209282
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph	2.9487116316267845
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her	2.879361626915441
his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes	2.3495487918023206
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance	2.154434690031884
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <unk> what <unk> felicity really was	2.248944724441235
an union of a different tendency and <unk> the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family	2.945837963113333
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine	2.883572184824433
mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	1.5009763240563732
to mr bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with <unk> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again	2.6826957952797255
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia	2.734947386083484
"it was greatly my wish that he should do so " he added "as soon as his marriage was fixed on	2.798620213602735
and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my niece's	2.578737428459314
it is mr wickham's intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army	2.582800823298921
he has the promise of an <unk> in general 's regiment now quartered in the north	3.3551291245646326
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom	3.013622267054238
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall <unk> a list according to his information	3.11241517471488
he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us	2.68431730802775
haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week	2.02517960838178
they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the <unk>	2.7308721294065403
she is well and <unk> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother	2.9298004502773205
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do	2.6095999749593393
but mrs bennet was not so well pleased with it	3.389640662781995
lydia's being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their <unk> in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites	1.715437896342879
"she is so fond of mrs forster " said she "it will be quite shocking to send her away	2.606775769603213
his daughter's request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative	2.6441230743751825
but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so <unk> to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished	1.6744824380115346
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north	3.085321335747804
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn	2.761699813343848
elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes	2.848035868435802
their sister's wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself	2.9534933411659594
the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner time	3.1569664196708977
the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them	2.511175310843039
smiles <unk> the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy	2.542587901892522
her mother <unk> <unk> embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	2.4244620170823286
their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial	2.7420602917662564
his countenance rather gained in <unk> and he scarcely opened his lips	2.7815206931071366
elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked	2.2246801356565182
lydia was lydia still <unk> <unk> wild noisy and <unk>	1.948335385041797
she turned from sister to sister <unk> their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there	2.1187853261287715
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all	2.192345972483447
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no <unk> in future to the impudence of an <unk> man	2.8265272497052556
she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who <unk> their confusion suffered no variation of colour	2.689150208674998
there was no want of discourse	2.628134150107852
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her <unk>	2.232735148777284
nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world	2.757681253193343
"only think of its being three months " she cried "since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time	2.838587946732729
when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again	2.879218573767276
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was	2.5510870590207735
her father lifted up his eyes	1.4227629257033703
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued "oh	2.392224212042013
mamma do the people here <unk> know i am married to day	2.226950254485634
i was afraid they might not and we <unk> william <unk> in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my <unk> and let my hand just rest upon the window <unk> so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing	1.715437896342879
elizabeth could bear it no longer	1.6307608328736973
she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour	2.7812759957363418
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mother's right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister "ah	2.7539517377213647
jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman	2.5921213530958886
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good spirits increased	2.959605404661916
she longed to see mrs philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called "mrs wickham " by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two <unk>	1.9952623149688797
is not he a charming man	1.8230723716662653
i am sure my sisters must all envy me	2.951694295511597
i only hope they may have half my good luck	2.301549870398828
they must all go to brighton	1.5191121688145457
that is the place to get husbands	2.4077819852973206
what a pity it is mamma we did not all go	2.058285545907285
"very true and if i had my will we should	2.4969494634211507
must it be so	1.3488285550315031
yes there is nothing in that	2.3486932006830825
you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us	2.235349458658167
we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all	2.976840689262124
"i should like it beyond any thing	1.8021966345772185
"i thank you for my share of the favour " said elizabeth "but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands	3.1262924852807896
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them	2.190038056988899
mr wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight	3.305315644872324
no one but mrs bennet <unk> that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home	2.761699813343848
these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not	2.50308986423549
wickham's affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydia's for him	2.7384310640296503
lydia was exceedingly fond of him	1.5467956131844234
he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him	2.6595753487447813
he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would <unk> more birds on the first of <unk> than any body else in the country	3.2720350722951226
are not you curious to hear how it was <unk>	2.299097944064201
"no really " replied elizabeth "i think there cannot be too little said on the subject	2.634257054209581
you are so strange	1.335919529213295
we were married you know at st <unk> because wickham's lodgings were in that parish	2.3054715995861224
and it was settled that we should all be there by <unk> o'clock	2.554116534968679
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church	3.087901512019156
well monday morning came and i was in such a <unk>	2.8064969897303538
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted	3.0892975391710094
and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon	2.6429320996339363
however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham	2.821754346116082
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat	2.592364200543064
"well and so we <unk> at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them	2.4244620170823286
if <unk> believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight	2.7311179369201666
to be sure london was rather thin but however the little <unk> was open	2.8092765389929073
and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it	2.655746008360667
but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out	2.5689427240273592
however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well	3.0439265425403756
repeated elizabeth in utter amazement	1.4148368172053596
he was to come there with wickham you know	2.886622303185204
i ought not to have said a word about it	1.8417608366591287
i promised them so <unk>	1.4742570760198128
what will wickham say	1.2287433274691737
it was to be such a secret	2.832870625638824
"if it was to be secret " said jane "say not another word on the subject	2.8930159481802127
certainly " said elizabeth though <unk> with curiosity "we will ask you no questions	2.925100800679113
"thank you " said lydia "for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry	2.8963815456698465
on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away	2.165105054830546
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information	2.4562410157450447
mr darcy had been at her sister's wedding	2.6513374720970537
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go	2.248523591561393
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none	2.8902841304257483
those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the <unk> light seemed most improbable	2.660553438847052
she could not bear such suspense and hastily <unk> a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended	2.3713737056616555
pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very <unk> reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance	2.610157215682537
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante	2.2758459260747883
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could	2.56670465657872
she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the <unk> and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial	1.9952623149688797
"my dear niece "i have just received your letter and shall <unk> this whole morning to answering it as i <unk> that a little writing will not <unk> what i have to tell you	2.761699813343848
don't think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side	2.8965576777100566
if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence	2.441813181346434
your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done	2.8347615848771994
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor	2.7175987161955715
mr darcy called and was shut up with him several hours	2.2466580456648684
it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <unk> as your's seems to have been	2.795354450024602
he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once	2.942727176209282
from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of <unk> for them	2.6277909404056623
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham's <unk> had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or <unk> in him	2.4816289228368253
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world	2.6480548585275265
his character was to speak for itself	2.263327701095528
he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself	2.4045169517802
if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him	3.294909103032714
he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us	2.2758459260747883
there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what	2.6826957952797255
this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town	2.893242909394908
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted	3.4073558140442874
she would not betray her trust i suppose without <unk> and <unk> for she really did know where her friend was to be found	3.4914232012222794
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her	2.9333679627633855
at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction	2.069207231208897
they were in street	1.9198763551894955
he saw wickham and afterwards <unk> on seeing lydia	2.0750390871341406
his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go	2.232735148777284
she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham	2.8346300785564496
she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when	3.0361778119246132
since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and <unk> a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design	2.9203810621667343
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill <unk> of lydia's flight on her own folly alone	2.610157215682537
he meant to <unk> his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it	3.156330283176703
he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on	3.336279834218711
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once	2.801368514435496
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage	3.290344562312668
but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country	2.738991071519889
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief	2.7485188720537783
they met several times for there was much to be discussed	2.196798105525114
wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable	2.611070765219411
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily <unk> seeing him till after the departure of the former	2.942727176209282
he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business	3.192344846990314
on saturday he came again	1.605863390671501
they met again on sunday and then i saw him too	2.4539300350135727
it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn	3.5424093524915174
but our visitor was very obstinate	1.6348263230062414
i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all	2.2876622639304425
he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one	2.7426445795970955
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole	2.4816289228368253
they <unk> it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved	2.7509485916520773
but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went <unk> against the <unk> and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his <unk> <unk> and give the praise where it was due	1.6050163175336876
but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people	2.5776013543927316
his debts are to be paid <unk> i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased	2.6601319165369945
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above	2.9807856909986272
it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham's character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was	2.942727176209282
perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or <unk> reserve can be answerable for the event	2.5179452635000295
but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair	2.610157215682537
when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish	2.1187853261287715
i believe i have now told you every thing	1.966885950485995
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure	3.302223077419593
lydia came to us and wickham had constant <unk> to the house	2.947104667355917
he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane's letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain	1.6618362775387496
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family	3.046989570903508
if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen	3.151654280140235
i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her	2.5197657040693016
mr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding	2.5921470062429015
will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him	2.859652142858405
his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire	2.70734922500867
his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry <unk> his wife may teach him	2.682516574501616
i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name	1.998773190022332
but slyness seems the fashion	1.3852217914984684
pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to <unk> me from <unk>	3.203912665561174
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park	2.6901436058574664
a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing	2.3830191674835897
but i must write no more	2.0473295981532025
the children have been wanting me this half hour	1.7502582864360914
the vague and unsettled suspicions which <unk> had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	1.7615770326037883
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem	2.8328174840454423
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her	2.639431590196899
but it was a hope shortly checked by other <unk> and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	1.968419447286612
brother in law of wickham	1.8673961127550067
he had to be sure done much	2.8719702779821668
she was ashamed to think how much	1.5954770856185119
but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief	2.575994756301412
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned	1.8139306939110624
it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return	2.919336466714233
they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him	2.244582441805219
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every <unk> speech she had ever directed towards him	2.5026353854683845
for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him	2.6537574637731245
she read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again	2.049964507349022
it was hardly enough but it pleased her	1.9217099413458545
she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself	2.609376796253394
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one's approach and before she could strike into another path she was <unk> by wickham	2.543543903485119
"i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister	2.1804172676240845
"you certainly do " she replied with a smile "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome	2.5010969439786828
"i should be sorry indeed if it were	2.1526568893183855
we were always good friends and now we are better	2.2799958031237133
are the others coming out	1.5323024836137844
"i do not know	1.3985793384992617
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton	2.724970649206409
and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley	2.9522603044879614
"i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle	3.0857337823676447
and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose	1.876235008984621
poor reynolds she was always very fond of me	2.0838776328190316
but of course she did not mention my name to you	2.732642341657355
"and what did she say	1.611146955978521
"that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well	2.8768994495049305
at such a distance as that you know things are <unk> misrepresented	2.945285418774117
"certainly " he replied <unk> his lips	2.2729551978678586
elizabeth hoped she had <unk> him but he soon afterwards said "i was surprised to see darcy in town last month	2.9634669102468014
we passed each other several times	1.484697708733944
i wonder what he can be doing there	1.9138200156859906
"perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh " said elizabeth	2.210208155141066
"it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year	2.520555986473369
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had	2.3237266739956906
"yes he introduced us to his sister	1.7553355364792815
"and do you like her	2.004494036013827
"i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two	2.4732661239355047
when i last saw her she was not very promising	2.8012283200021955
"i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age	2.7843112311392533
"i do not recollect that we did	2.7636757800902134
"i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had	2.7472745975303434
a most delightful place	1.5941282028677457
it would have suited me in every respect	2.242721568023502
"how should you have liked making sermons	1.8619497279380892
i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing	2.8637787025435983
one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me	3.5199987001587765
the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness	2.477819020446465
but it was not to be	1.6880536237768982
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent	2.2498213753374596
"i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron	3.1571633510053454
yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember	2.9661537832814484
"i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so <unk> to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been <unk> accordingly	2.232735148777284
and it was not wholly without foundation	3.091309787127428
you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it	2.3157435045641925
they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sister's sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile "come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know	2.023589647725157
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet	2.2758459260747883
my dear lydia " she cried "when shall we meet again	2.578415165905477
not these two or three years perhaps	2.0955213952645573
<unk> to me very often my dear	2.069545919360898
my sisters may write to me	1.5659201000422958
they will have nothing else to do	1.5966638979206165
mr wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's	2.0181243463306284
he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things	1.9266092140628774
he <unk> and <unk> and makes love to us all	2.776237901768234
i am prodigiously proud of him	1.4035024571384553
i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law	2.070104368283094
the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days	2.4340346437071045
one seems so <unk> without them	1.757613763638561
"this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter " said elizabeth	2.312148947365039
"it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single	2.197019603683829
"it is no such thing	1.5266083403835367
lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off	2.83579501164058
if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon	3.027978350777007
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation	2.639124963520463
mrs bennet was quite in the <unk>	2.3793690531138165
she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns	2.291974442319603
"well so much the better	1.4287265593046448
not that i care about it though	2.4305045512086965
he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again	2.958127411620641
but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it	3.0575688653931414
and who knows what may happen	1.5863036060927662
and so is it quite certain he is coming	2.0796163807668453
"you may depend on it " replied the other "for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true	2.232735148777284
he comes down on thursday at the <unk> very likely on wednesday	2.4460049112229263
she was going to the <unk> she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of <unk> just fit to be killed	3.046989570903508
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour	3.6243419792255724
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said "i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed	2.085205857248754
but don't imagine it was from any silly cause	2.0152238121382227
i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at	2.6598867216499587
i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain	2.1765276866505854
i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him	2.75612593574743
elizabeth did not know what to make of it	2.8056521038128133
had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she <unk> as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission or being bold enough to come without it	1.8529220216409523
"yet it is hard " she sometimes thought "that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally <unk> without raising all this <unk>	2.492427960437532
i will leave him to himself	1.616510750161934
in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it	3.046989570903508
they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them	2.4052370921633135
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again	2.7102223772319225
"as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear " said mrs bennet "you will wait on him of course	2.84117045159501
you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters	2.6493913379739396
but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a <unk> <unk> again	3.0887709726400043
"if he wants our society let him seek it	1.8168129102139232
he knows where we live	1.4755635078964018
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again	2.5180286349546295
"well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him	2.9199308608430043
but however that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined	2.1747979831865187
we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon	2.3424186332356562
that will make <unk> with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him	2.519438870183566
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they did	2.610157215682537
as the day of his arrival drew near "i begin to be sorry that he comes at all " said jane to her sister	3.1033097369029963
"it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of	2.9398995702038073
happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over	2.117495967622348
"i wish i could say any thing to comfort you " replied elizabeth "but it is wholly out of my power	3.073978630438194
you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a <unk> is denied me because you have always so much	2.8553308726190836
mrs bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could	2.8128454801002043
she <unk> the days that must <unk> before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before	2.725244005338701
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house	2.4903400447380886
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy	1.8266925740946882
jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw mr darcy with him and sat down again by her sister	2.848035868435802
"there is a gentleman with him mamma " said kitty "who can it be	2.4011675504205896
"some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know	2.41497304435564
replied kitty "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before	2.229226174402565
mr <unk> his name	1.399348871884442
and so it does i <unk>	1.758082064274961
well any friend of mr bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him	2.907319968075363
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern	2.2043065333450222
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <unk> letter	2.7622844465856513
both sisters were uncomfortable enough	1.5058453451314637
each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley's friend without being heard by either of them	2.321954250288982
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiner's letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him	2.610157215682537
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had <unk> but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <unk> and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley	1.6744824380115346
her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first <unk> his altered behaviour in derbyshire	2.848035868435802
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added <unk> to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be <unk>	2.154434690031884
but she would not be secure	2.622497610374823
"let me first see how he behaves " said she "it will then be early enough for expectation	2.444144461662493
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door	2.547788126064306
jane looked a little <unk> than usual but more <unk> than elizabeth had expected	2.788699723797156
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command	2.7305961495239703
she had ventured only one glance at darcy	1.7303299397598297
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley	2.870119889885926
it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture	2.7308972190687926
he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when <unk> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend	2.761699813343848
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from <unk> infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied	2.6826957952797255
darcy after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing	2.7146529005511857
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire	3.1681047598655736
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself	2.987386037930413
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground	2.053525026457146
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed	2.2022440621120207
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so	1.7740117682811392
"could i expect it to be otherwise	2.414012176529707
"yet why did he come	1.642767933348708
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak	2.9344128116928774
"it is a long time mr bingley since you went away " said mrs bennet	2.519058064974681
he readily agreed to it	1.2722023153625333
"i began to be afraid you would never come back again	2.531117200539521
people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true	2.952003036169198
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away	2.2853578165075805
miss lucas is married and settled	1.6406054044567469
and one of my own daughters	3.003186335997419
it was in the times and the <unk> i know though it was not put in as it ought to be	3.676546494395947
it was only said <unk> george wickham <unk>	2.1606700930840947
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it	2.5237665957929627
did you see it	1.3704821763280717
bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations	2.6916589652791076
how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell	2.826359091610265
"it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married " continued her mother "but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me	2.4816289228368253
they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long	2.6679314970898647
his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars	3.107683766064331
he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves	2.1633500052633368
elizabeth who knew this to be <unk> at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat	3.4896406922802834
it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present	2.794870052590302
a few weeks he believed	1.8519323684769882
"when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley " said her mother "i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennet's manor	2.577711488928517
i am sure he will be <unk> happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the <unk> for you	4.1720125609350855
elizabeth's misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention	1.7055301242096332
were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	2.8670207271747996
at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion	2.633048194840647
"the first wish of my heart " said she to herself "is never more to be in company with either of them	3.117554580468615
their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this	2.073500677488221
let me never see either one or the other again	2.2797890367374753
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no <unk> received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re <unk> the admiration of her former lover	2.6826957952797255
when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention	2.8346515953117106
he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so <unk>	3.100370468638467
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	3.0686266859923186
but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent	2.992747035190973
"you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley " she added "for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned	2.6826957952797255
i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement	3.1932060485561657
they then went away	1.1011271897313588
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year	1.7301957388458942
as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <unk> them more	2.677360836216957
mr darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her	1.6146721500002847
"why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent " said she "did he come at all	2.8673159786100184
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	2.0768849475879168
if he fears me why come hither	1.6463798777951142
if he no longer cares for me why silent	2.354532982843611
i will think no more about him	1.8961714259510247
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth	2.7030359331067406
"now " said she "that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy	2.631015095728504
i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming	2.737957480977892
i am glad he <unk> here on tuesday	2.0679823604104492
it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance	2.3115099898071247
"yes very indifferent indeed " said elizabeth laughingly	2.660410176037626
"oh jane take care	1.1999663126230762
"my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now	3.2844281852163557
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour's visit had revived	2.4244620170823286
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as <unk> were in very good time	3.046989570903508
when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister	2.674168163296067
her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas <unk> to invite him to sit by herself	2.2958041398000604
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided	2.4463694040756874
he placed himself by her	1.4445852384768523
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend	2.311427447908001
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his <unk> to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm	2.4816289228368253
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane's happiness and his own would be speedily secured	2.4244620170823286
though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour	2.2168663256052064
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour	2.7488370581527133
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage	2.3488154733111815
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did	2.848035868435802
her mother's <unk> made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family	2.154434690031884
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend	2.7174474753067033
"if he does not come to me then " said she "i shall give him up for ever	2.850581877171404
the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas	2.776583700138289
the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth <unk> out the coffee in so close a <unk> that there was not a single <unk> near her which would admit of a chair	2.4244620170823286
and on the gentlemen's approaching one of the girls moved <unk> to her than ever and said in a whisper "the men shan't come and part us i am determined	3.162277660168379
we want none of them do we	1.873537628041683
she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was <unk> against herself for being so silly	2.8193234818622077
"a man who has once been refused	2.066814366058642
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love	2.285120552662911
is there one among the sex who would not <unk> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman	2.5834399941313286
there is no indignity so <unk> to their feelings	3.0673308152010987
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee <unk> himself and she seized the opportunity of saying "is your sister at pemberley still	2.7276728085398854
"yes she will remain there till christmas	1.775071128307245
have all her friends left her	1.9202023780589297
"mrs annesley is with her	1.3652019827403368
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success	2.9000712793110894
he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again he walked away	2.874810647369521
when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a <unk> to her mother's <unk> for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	1.8139306939110624
she now lost every expectation of pleasure	1.5788663933936429
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as <unk> as herself	2.4816289228368253
"well girls " said she as soon as they were left to themselves "what say you to the day	2.8837810258116754
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you	1.918778708775209
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw	2.440662729508794
the <unk> was <unk> to a turn and everybody said they never saw so <unk> a <unk>	2.93694035372655
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas's last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the <unk> were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three <unk> <unk> at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty	1.968419447286612
mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not	2.0283716290238245
and what do you think she said besides	2.182544801379015
mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at <unk> she did indeed	2.6522649770621602
i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously	2.7520350727829013
mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	1.715437896342879
"it has been a very agreeable day " said miss bennet to elizabeth	3.5544285379756784
"the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other	2.000982108923102
i hope we may often meet again	1.8190495141036176
"lizzy you must not do so	2.276878584545104
you must not suspect me	2.1193833444343997
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection	2.6422302524154637
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man	2.537129360352038
"you are very cruel " said her sister "you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment	2.689654640360085
"and how impossible in others	1.387714723601948
"but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge	2.6425542493552907
"that is a question which i hardly know how to answer	2.3372181382630974
forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante	2.755811442581848
a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone	2.4077022343253884
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time	2.745882413709364
he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits	2.5725439301585453
<unk> time you call " said she "i hope we shall be more lucky	2.8059266405703465
he should be particularly happy at any time c	2.473067164466234
and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them	2.5123287814246096
"can you come to morrow	1.5454058302204046
yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity	2.7709650035487132
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed	3.091649007291841
in ran mrs bennet to her daughter's room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out "my dear jane make haste and hurry down	2.390604671017423
he is come mr bingley is come	2.141651076527091
make haste make haste	1.2129950008812271
here <unk> come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown	2.6556987963076018
never mind miss lizzy's hair	1.3506624437157615
"we will be down as soon as we can " said jane "but i dare say kitty is <unk> than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago	2.942727176209282
what has she to do with it	2.0285537036621393
come be quick be quick	1.4451716204529594
where is your <unk> my dear	1.9188901883782536
but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters	2.9982972504858294
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening	2.4635529595642582
after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument	2.427493673643681
elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very <unk> said "what is the matter mamma	2.9766465334073593
what do you keep winking at me for	2.483668074559017
i did not wink at you	3.1758688418443835
she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to <unk> such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty "come here my love i want to speak to you " took her out of the room	2.3713737056616555
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such <unk> and her intreaty that she would not give into it	2.7647440554462728
in a few minutes mrs bennet half opened the door and called out "lizzy my dear i want to speak with you	2.8125128315049217
elizabeth was forced to go	1.794045059445874
"we may as well leave them by themselves you know " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall	3.243744085774992
"kitty and i are going <unk> to sit in my dressing room	2.1596678297296217
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room	2.7765513861667332
mrs bennet's schemes for this day were <unk>	1.8361325850413575
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged <unk> of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	2.232735148777284
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennet's means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	2.6826957952797255
after this day jane said no more of her indifference	2.4444138385139698
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time	2.6066571109348473
bingley was punctual to his <unk> and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on	3.1874646946334217
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	2.3863620970895782
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs bennet's <unk> was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter	3.290344562312668
elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to <unk> her mother's schemes	2.3713737056616555
but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her	2.942727176209282
on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the <unk> as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all	2.053525026457146
their situation was awkward enough but her's she thought was still worse	2.05778723261284
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	2.543415681893425
she added "by far too much	1.4195500953491829
i do not deserve it	3.183905256577917
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express	2.0692091934697503
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane	2.211950586932799
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present	2.857288843355061
"i must go instantly to my mother " she cried	2.078693183846888
"i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself	2.6992558274444143
lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family	2.9368418415380555
how shall i bear so much happiness	1.8971267416554531
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty	2.6062978627391513
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation	2.5528928592215077
"and this " said she "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection	3.342099065694928
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance	2.101896532869505
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose	2.8497051805270157
"where is your sister	1.3635016813350764
said he hastily as he opened the door	1.5928297305263608
"with my mother up stairs	1.470621357696174
she will be down in a moment i dare say	2.84527403301756
he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister	2.6470629272754866
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship	1.9609278987715615
they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane's perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for <unk> the excellent understanding and <unk> excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself	1.566048452832833
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever	2.732933941278252
mrs bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was	1.9952623149688797
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said <unk> i congratulate you	2.4816289228368253
you will be a very happy woman	3.2420634897578813
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness	2.5981879169044166
"you are a good girl " he replied "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled	3.1619179418556986
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together	2.584501064715091
your <unk> are by no means unlike	2.3471464329195464
you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will <unk> you and so generous that you will always <unk> your income	2.845211609214712
"i hope not so	1.224157838454685
my dear mr bennet " cried his wife "what are you talking of	2.298493405414976
why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more	1.4934629287514318
then addressing her daughter "oh	1.5363401750032142
i knew how it would be	1.1452517887965978
i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together	3.0107404125892776
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen	1.9943144679924165
wickham lydia were all forgotten	1.6297773471845503
jane was beyond competition her favourite child	1.7588044448160496
at that moment she cared for no other	2.046150536370851
mary <unk> for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter	2.9910751098371477
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some <unk> neighbour who could not be enough <unk> had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept	2.085205857248754
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief	2.996665614764529
"he has made me so happy " said she one evening "by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring	3.1167762002572412
i had not believed it possible	2.497145196333786
"i suspected as much " replied elizabeth	1.6981928566051645
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects	2.7536493987120196
but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other	2.2758459260747883
it would <unk> me indeed to see you again the <unk> of miss bingley's pretended regard	3.710614660479723
"would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again	2.814148618727523
"he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty	3.2527732891693515
"i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed	1.9632319787184702
lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all	2.1364872625955087
if i could but see you as happy	2.5232712286147345
"if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you	3.0321080308743076
till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness	2.5345151691137415
no no let me <unk> for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time	2.7440000928649035
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton	2.9413443859527875
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <unk> family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	2.610157215682537
one morning about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	1.9187520990478337
it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the <unk> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	2.959676933977698
the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who <unk> it were familiar to them	2.387100777085742
as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the <unk> of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery	3.046989570903508
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered	2.5209185815574
it was lady catherine de bourgh	1.2744231935068138
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt	2.4816289228368253
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word	2.44163862579587
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance though no request of introduction had been made	2.55673525124784
mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness	2.4963836645878192
after sitting for a moment in silence she said very <unk> to elizabeth "i hope you are well miss bennet	3.029098034212371
that lady i suppose is your mother	2.11930049183815
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was	1.5678527132277142
"and that i suppose is one of your sisters	2.409594443954741
"yes madam " said mrs bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine	2.9154602558648466
"she is my youngest girl but one	1.817986376597006
my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family	2.6661863257749907
"it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's	2.425523228877699
"this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full <unk> mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added "may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well	2.023589647725157
i saw them the night before <unk> elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	2.891444440525937
but no letter appeared and she was completely <unk>	2.5886871959518403
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth "miss bennet there seemed to be a <unk> kind of a little <unk> on one side of your lawn	1.968419447286612
i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company	3.304705852090342
"go my dear " cried her mother "and shew her ladyship about the different walks	2.369611255814883
i think she will be pleased with the <unk>	2.461606169736473
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs	2.2148356011346806
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it	2.685593584286645
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable	2.6356134596485505
"how could i ever think her like her nephew	2.0730614127745777
said she as she looked in her face	2.3041705848331238
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner "you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither	2.852195031502404
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	1.374483315641132
"indeed you are mistaken madam	1.767502000355827
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here	2.801835856168338
"miss bennet " replied her ladyship in an angry tone "you ought to know that i am not to be <unk> with	3.169812946724067
but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so	2.3230891116693058
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it	2.6837715541378366
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago	2.3653161530157365
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy	2.3713737056616555
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you	2.232735148777284
"if you believed it impossible to be true " said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain "i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far	2.9040662485748605
what could your ladyship propose by it	1.8178273171652255
"at once to insist upon having such a report universally <unk>	2.1892627977554655
"your coming to longbourn to see me and my family " said elizabeth coolly "will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence	3.0303882995485796
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it	1.9073959075504612
has it not been <unk> <unk> by yourselves	2.3956888962986973
"i never heard that it was	1.7947718297987545
"and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it	2.527387869605476
"i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship	2.2949464740533854
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer	2.4658024698399506
"this is not to be borne	2.798239334060628
has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage	1.629399195608338
"your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	1.9784991840132669
"it ought to be so it must be so while he <unk> the use of his reason	3.2638948469702735
you may have drawn him in	1.8824987925853698
"if i have i shall be the last person to confess it	2.903691466314686
"miss bennet do you know who i am	2.1307605180995326
i have not been accustomed to such language as this	2.6763422046434813
this match to which you have the presumption to <unk> can never take place	3.1372548867666414
mr darcy is engaged to my daughter	2.443373825796987
now what have you to say	1.8020174996364973
"only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me	3.2267000519789577
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied "the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind	2.627104781124024
it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of her's	2.9358217009470913
while in their <unk> we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly <unk> to the family	2.085205857248754
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends	2.2330962152270004
to his <unk> engagement with miss de bourgh	1.8318882858375858
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy	2.102793040939153
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin	2.2749473338510158
"yes and i had heard it before	2.8668397162111185
but what is that to me	2.1115333460390393
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage	2.8722700189211987
its <unk> depended on others	1.4050569424347419
if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice	2.779210405133023
and if i am that choice why may not i accept him	2.5104977143166174
yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all	2.3196816583722035
you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him	2.168250245823324
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us	2.587168077210129
"but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine	2.834017613706702
i am ashamed of you	1.3620648180544273
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring	2.142149180051818
is nothing due to me on that score	1.9909051713934967
"let us sit down	1.1115962397806043
you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be <unk> from it	2.767150914998868
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims	2.6402436845085977
" that will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me	2.4288331706194155
hear me in silence	1.3879707474028262
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other	1.8985386801769812
they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the father's from respectable honourable and <unk> though <unk> families	2.439179055107816
their fortune on both sides is splendid	1.711076368259436
they are destined for each other by the voice of every <unk> of their <unk> houses and what is to divide them	2.8307505077610737
the <unk> pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune	2.4947130000162296
is this to be endured	1.7249952675581606
but it must not shall not be	1.7833324204270065
if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up	3.2602011651388025
he is a gentleman i am a gentleman's daughter so far we are equal	2.856969101446349
you are a gentleman's daughter	1.7829508388414252
but who was your mother	1.5341374625645054
who are your uncles and <unk>	1.445695743071563
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition	2.2145327641597636
"whatever my connections may be " said elizabeth "if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you	2.766259190340193
"tell me once for all are you engaged to him	2.0783725200257206
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moment's deliberation "i am not	2.8892908287742713
lady catherine seemed pleased	1.7285853296769877
"and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement	2.2421975304608774
"i will make no promise of the kind	1.9556083047813912
"miss bennet i am shocked and astonished	1.8079657390870207
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman	2.2245868302661895
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require	2.8911266819941797
"and i certainly never shall give it	1.7216251345376083
i am not to be <unk> into anything so wholly unreasonable	2.8382987618352455
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable	2.6165750396432683
supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin	2.76694017226114
you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such <unk> as these	2.385625531737265
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine	2.413008385409737
i must beg therefore to be <unk> no farther on the subject	2.913418253609583
"not so hasty if you please	1.547434035126152
i have by no means done	2.177086704607727
to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add	2.7301605909022264
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement	2.2297332364304117
i know it all that the young man's marrying her was a <unk> up business at the expence of your father and uncles	3.0966788613354854
and is such a girl to be my nephew's sister	2.577505583866099
is her husband is the son of his late father's steward to be his brother	2.283245524036741
of what are you thinking	1.6699377479617756
are the <unk> of pemberley to be thus <unk>	3.2292926244683904
"you have <unk> me in every possible method	2.5718848643559595
i must beg to return to the house	1.8275078070783197
lady catherine rose also and they turned back	1.8335999138663954
her ladyship was highly incensed	1.677190622608942
do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody	2.782097361439847
you know my sentiments	1.5871743038332915
"you are then resolved to have him	1.7389666269133448
"i have said no such thing	1.7063743553991468
i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion <unk> my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me	2.6907199240351516
you refuse to <unk> the claims of duty honour and gratitude	2.5781822575398614
<unk> duty nor honour nor gratitude " replied elizabeth "have any possible claim on me in the present instance	2.669293555673438
and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <unk>	2.085205857248754
"and this is your real opinion	2.0415071859195133
this is your <unk> resolve	1.9913246494676795
do not imagine miss bennet that your <unk> will ever be gratified	2.9038820761134834
i came to try you	1.8818095628552785
i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point	2.30247863830272
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added "i take no leave of you miss bennet	2.785934954717653
i send no compliments to your mother	1.7280267120128328
you deserve no such attention	1.5213461302413713
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself	2.801149473592753
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs	2.0183603597765094
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself	2.4726599270174274
"she did not choose it " said her daughter "she would go	2.720125377764548
"she is a very fine looking woman	2.576313301434515
and her calling here was prodigiously civil	1.6771211910138535
for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well	2.342381970654226
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you	2.710705493195985
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy	2.483824805178358
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible	2.5149953374533727
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly	2.783276264517051
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy	2.340591207294979
it was a rational scheme to be sure	2.722116394907864
but from what the report of their engagement could <unk> elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea	1.8529220216409523
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together	2.990005992312827
and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time	2.192345972483447
in <unk> lady catherine's expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <unk> in this interference	3.0814487238509356
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce	2.1187853261287715
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the <unk> of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his <unk> side	1.6618362775387496
if he had been <unk> before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity <unk> could make him	2.154434690031884
in that case he would return no more	2.0071400622179896
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way	2.811457762280861
"if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days " she added "i shall know how to understand it	2.886397280174312
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they <unk> satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had <unk> mrs bennet's curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	2.154434690031884
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	3.1549125371168363
"lizzy " said he "i was going to look for you come into my room	3.0278674262369685
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held	2.942727176209282
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with <unk> all the <unk> explanations	3.3600046313703813
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down	2.7396226051815384
as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents	2.1874480328474597
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your <unk> to discover the name of your admirer	2.695118432120656
this letter is from mr collins	1.6605348981340045
<unk> very much to the purpose of course	2.547592779788926
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured <unk> lucases	2.776092993084095
what relates to yourself is as follows	1.8750157897428825
<unk> thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been <unk> by the same authority	2.4816289228368253
your daughter elizabeth it is <unk> will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most <unk> <unk> in this <unk>	2.192345972483447
"can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this	1.8698341062252064
yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may <unk> by a precipitate <unk> with this gentleman's proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of	2.321954250288982
"have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is	1.9073914952050826
but now it comes out	1.5910325949634112
we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye	2.669828961918767
" mr darcy you see is the man	2.372697942815203
now lizzy i think i have surprised you	2.182307012014833
could he or the lucases have <unk> on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the <unk> more effectually to what they related	2.7635080738663333
mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a <unk> and who probably never looked at you in his life	3.0371808294315943
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile	2.4420913643689994
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her	2.0645810576857997
"are you not diverted	1.3615615356075685
i thought it my duty to give the <unk> intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	2.2758459260747883
"mr collins moreover adds " "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad business has been so well <unk> up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known	2.4244620170823286
i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from <unk> my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married	2.4004449710149003
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing	2.4571795477599734
" that is his notion of christian forgiveness	1.8261019263443359
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's situation and his expectation of a young olive branch	3.0655467235776093
but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it	1.9371111418414606
you are not going to be <unk> i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report	2.970694180571048
but it is so strange	2.6408199103300527
"yes that is what makes it amusing	1.9760583733052095
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd	2.84509745024002
much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collins's correspondence for any consideration	3.071479088672877
nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and <unk> of my son in law	2.9636633395145418
and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report	1.9440356192972588
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it	3.0858973186154834
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not	3.0997120009564516
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried	2.2012665021483486
her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr darcy's indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much	2.192345972483447
it was agreed to	1.1362409547059817
mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together	2.764627252242177
bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to <unk> them	2.575489163820754
i can no longer help thanking you for your <unk> kindness to my poor sister	2.251516740078834
ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it	2.9950684476279887
"i am sorry exceedingly sorry " replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion "that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness	2.866819866434725
i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted	3.468378067741278
"you must not blame my aunt	1.9245221638882628
let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many <unk> for the sake of <unk> them	2.543345761304649
but your family owe me nothing	1.5765625413849906
much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you	2.84819554565431
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word	2.449924272662901
if your feelings are still what they were last <unk> tell me so at once	2.577084184248991
my affections and wishes are <unk> but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever	2.6145902801085237
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very <unk> gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances	1.8529220216409523
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight <unk> over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in <unk> of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable	1.8139306939110624
they walked on without knowing in what direction	1.9957008428933705
there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects	3.147466783475294
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling <unk> on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship's apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give	1.4806572771858608
but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly <unk>	2.143665348317977
"it taught me to hope " said he "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before	2.737102183829187
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely <unk> decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine <unk> and openly	2.896835038233815
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied "yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that	2.4734442436046495
after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations	2.5803803480989265
"what did you say of me that i did not deserve	3.0209338080365
for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken <unk> my behaviour to you at the time had merited the <unk> reproof	2.4386698145515378
i cannot think of it without abhorrence	2.580108753426186
"we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <unk> to that evening " said elizabeth	2.2533133107370715
"the conduct of neither if <unk> examined will be <unk> but since then we have both i hope improved in civility	2.7481529731808743
"i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself	2.1614771083546405
the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months <unk> painful to me	3.0393529980164318
your reproof so well applied i shall never forget <unk> you behaved in a more gentleman like manner	1.8618338651726072
those were your words	1.305573481074156
you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have <unk> me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice	2.944455842621102
"i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression	2.2597525111208614
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way	3.0825357382308187
"i can easily believe it	1.487527711367317
you thought me then <unk> of every proper feeling i am sure you did	2.901407788727984
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me	2.8842340095837575
do not repeat what i then said	1.5105274634056074
these recollections will not do at all	2.1989665616420098
darcy mentioned his letter	1.3008805706117967
"did it " said he "did it soon make you think better of me	2.7296834329378816
did you on reading it give any credit to its contents	2.1064752890718705
she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed	2.5336091143318034
"i knew " said he "that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary	2.9381463951832085
i hope you have destroyed the letter	2.4591408926613134
there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again	2.6041890784416433
"the letter shall certainly be <unk> if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <unk> they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that <unk>	2.2758459260747883
"when i wrote that letter " replied darcy "i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit	2.8919510797742327
"the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so	2.238418299196491
the adieu is <unk> itself	1.5337461036703122
but think no more of the letter	2.0276511782200775
the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten	2.848035868435802
you must learn some of my philosophy	1.8186397929337959
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure	2.225479132013066
"i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind	2.064756614108174
your <unk> must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance	2.6510242018350985
painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be <unk>	1.882631565941657
i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle	2.8793292797990166
as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper	2.5710970531682658
i was given good <unk> but left to follow them in pride and conceit	2.368197015318072
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was <unk> and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and <unk> to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own	1.5947870582948211
such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest <unk> elizabeth	2.425559762446724
what do i not owe you	1.7692869909393694
you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous	2.0887169286557037
by you i was properly humbled	1.9412108400983752
i came to you without a doubt of my reception	2.636098403680918
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	2.2754995995287475
what will you think of my vanity	2.293564102921527
i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses	2.143128293385821
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong	2.0676895238677457
how you must have hated me after that evening	2.300955316481243
"i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley	2.3572824349353
you <unk> me for coming	1.8711891849051019
"no indeed i felt nothing but surprise	2.076635139030732
"your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you	2.525439570805404
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due	2.8179220020656968
"my object then " replied darcy "was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to	1.9952623149688797
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you	2.731248715419963
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend	1.6265507027536246
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther	2.852611744765079
after walking several miles in a <unk> manner and too <unk> to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their <unk> that it was time to be at home	2.848035868435802
"what could become of mr bingley and jane	1.8281336732792903
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs	1.8917176984892743
darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it	2.6282277863130563
when i went away i felt that it would soon happen	2.8285257065707907
"that is to say you had given your permission	2.4681754510464553
i guessed as much	1.2159407197501986
and though he exclaimed at the <unk> she found that it had been pretty much the case	3.6210998825588496
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent	2.3049963373850315
his surprise was great	1.3050976973184913
he had never had the slightest suspicion	2.5377073742799166
i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <unk> i felt no doubt of their happiness together	2.232735148777284
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend	2.4755070676372144
"did you speak from your own observation " said she "when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring	2.831639719081972
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection	2.5840141339738896
"and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him	2.322813765245179
i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him	2.520654489355392
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him	3.1842281869863984
but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments	2.6332010517151136
he has heartily <unk> me now	1.6288634318662698
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself	2.8612525549004313
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be <unk> at and it was rather too early to begin	3.3096523456188636
in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house	2.9528297084100656
in the hall they parted	1.7947668615067538
"my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to	2.8085218589060497
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table	2.9074950399555926
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge	2.7771761681833294
the evening passed quietly <unk> by any thing extraordinary	2.3955960772332
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the <unk> were silent	2.2780320456339505
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <unk> in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her	2.3713737056616555
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	2.154434690031884
at night she opened her heart to jane	2.2098883552097286
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet's general habits she was absolutely incredulous here	2.3108393630724837
"you are <unk> lizzy	1.3943320763499347
engaged to mr darcy	1.2020000646398388
no no you shall not deceive me	1.9180722934858496
i know it to be impossible	1.8866642561950375
"this is a wretched beginning indeed	2.0325321965009002
my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not	2.635645921030865
he still loves me and we are engaged	2.2124414464188598
jane looked at her <unk>	1.967139382879752
i know how much you dislike him	2.008459451244291
"you know nothing of the matter	1.954316378392731
that is all to be forgot	2.3018264473327026
but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable	2.1256609279259666
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself	2.645838877626172
miss bennet still looked all amazement	1.5937670961573132
elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth	2.474227626264127
can it be really so	1.9376078958402396
yet now i must believe you " cried jane	2.1251142248196944
"my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain	2.6121102656610877
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him	2.556999047695152
it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world	2.7354412698597863
but are you pleased jane	1.8342190634420792
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight	1.8522816426362396
but we considered it we talked of it as impossible	2.11893254829159
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do	2.505865613919825
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all	2.7388565976238017
"what do you mean	1.089566774072064
"why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley	2.5295804494638725
i am afraid you will be angry	2.6933248585271974
"my dearest sister now be be serious	1.7525615442607052
i want to talk very seriously	2.187404422815976
let me know every thing that i am to know without delay	2.8622024284666923
will you tell me how long you have loved him	2.153900566702375
"it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began	2.5775270832242
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley	2.3698387593777714
another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment	2.5709670546238415
i always had a value for him	1.8229689415322117
were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley's friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me	2.761699813343848
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton	2.6340281763186564
i owe all that i know of it to another not to you	3.1080847155037565
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	2.05052185543794
she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend	3.1711090872821197
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia's marriage	2.2970535924712334
all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation	2.013391243767818
cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morning "if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley	3.012775965543325
i had no notion but he would go a <unk> or something or other and not <unk> us with his company	3.093595314145869
what shall we do with him	1.7954104728790066
lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley's way	2.7225061726909616
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <unk>	2.401297917363149
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud "mr bennet have you no more <unk> <unk> in which lizzy may lose her way again to day	2.023589647725157
"i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty " said mrs bennet "to walk to <unk> mount this morning	2.776395120062269
it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view	3.248873804618638
"it may do very well for the others " replied mr bingley "but i am sure it will be too much for kitty	3.440432976441297
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home	2.8482890835133796
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented	2.309736719308081
as she went up stairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her saying "i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself	2.6342103451238543
but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane's sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then	2.9665567881079014
so do not put yourself to inconvenience	1.9070445208675815
during their walk it was resolved that mr bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening	2.2313079222675345
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's	2.1675155721671704
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	2.6411477203191263
but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first <unk> of her disapprobation	1.8738174228603839
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme	3.1282777060118554
she did not fear her father's opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be <unk> him with fears and regrets in <unk> of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile	1.6050163175336876
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper "go to your father he wants you in the library	2.6826957952797255
she was gone directly	1.604488392408923
her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious	2.2618972520731204
are you out of your senses to be accepting this man	2.017697321197368
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate	2.2448099580780068
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy	2.6491904773326413
<unk> in other words you are determined to have him	2.097196293436284
he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane	2.86779969059159
but will they make you happy	1.610369830957473
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him	3.07122575934681
"i do i do like him " she replied with tears in her eyes "i love him	2.3301065156838576
indeed he has no improper pride	1.7253813052317626
he is perfectly amiable	1.2440445613140274
you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms	2.905757496959846
"lizzy " said her father "i have given him my consent	2.9056574215432724
he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask	2.7202864701918608
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him	2.85580567537694
but let me advise you to think better of it	2.152544481863503
i know your disposition lizzy	1.4792666955938396
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior	2.683127202632006
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage	2.246463924573216
my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life	2.304615758665487
you know not what you are about	2.5799387574571973
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the <unk> change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the <unk> of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father's incredulity and <unk> him to the match	1.5237960002208242
"well my dear " said he when she ceased speaking "i have no more to say	2.4736644737667017
if this be the case he deserves you	2.2593183303800544
i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy	3.106346532074329
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia	2.543221915048758
"this is an evening of wonders indeed	1.8342181647893925
and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the <unk> debts and got him his commission	2.5022286680623735
had it been your uncle's doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way	2.4635914348121575
i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will <unk> and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter	3.114395329514895
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr collins's letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room "if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure	1.9429496147158305
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure	2.7744956938887864
every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed <unk> away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time	2.761699813343848
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication	2.9762733639711803
its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable	2.2797543478018634
nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general <unk> to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them	2.2758459260747883
she began at length to recover to <unk> about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself	2.35723501625164
who would have thought it	1.500486923830348
and is it really true	1.6231294317000475
what <unk> money what <unk> what carriages you will have	2.078745149985178
jane's is nothing to it nothing at all	1.988325906823969
i am so pleased so happy	1.8961221448385894
such a charming man	1.3025627781557179
oh my dear lizzy	1.342431001856655
i hope he will overlook it	1.5997143117058787
a house in town	1.0947942335161849
every thing that is charming	1.9855487080257432
what will become of me	1.3604465332842077
i shall go distracted	1.4592450147635596
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away	2.553600446209637
but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her	3.005457100872483
"my dearest child " she cried "i can think of nothing else	2.114613113991745
ten thousand a year and very likely more	1.3267041651733387
<unk> as good as a lord	1.8315944249647782
and a special licence	1.0458180868193712
you must and shall be married by a special licence	1.9979018101963526
but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow	3.0242080721125513
this was a sad <unk> of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations' consent there was still something to be wished for	2.232735148777284
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion	1.9952623149688797
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	3.162277660168379
"i admire all my three sons in law highly " said he	2.0976502125660392
"wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane's	2.8769430745273206
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her	2.539360783538036
"how could you begin	1.337317689906821
"i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place	2.4690990635906123
"i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation	2.245869192875266
it is too long ago	1.5617666061191307
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun	3.3886957291355606
"my beauty you had early <unk> and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not	2.4816289228368253
"for the liveliness of your mind i did	1.7622228397224686
"you may as well call it impertinence at once	2.0273049109153445
it was very little less	2.4878602323511267
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention	2.3004740524737515
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone	2.2178295538431447
i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them	2.195422383594628
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so <unk> courted you	2.154434690031884
there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable	2.6127387721836763
to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love	2.542476795469377
"was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield	2.355060808223314
who could have done less for her	1.8174305768813794
but make a virtue of it by all means	2.115401137210736
my good qualities are under your protection and you are to <unk> them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here	1.6050163175336876
why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me	2.1170412812280155
"because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement	2.1542108727112548
"but i was embarrassed	1.4085141512092516
"and so was i	1.2285482255162474
"you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner	2.2616695776028464
"how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it	3.087432517401118
i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you	2.8632986543060155
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect	2.120030393821741
too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort <unk> from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject	2.7679193016284267
this will never do	1.3871013243148749
"you need not distress yourself	1.6038325860130522
the moral will be perfectly fair	1.682909313851762
lady catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts	2.2969266100849826
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's	2.9882474286427905
my aunt's intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing	2.6398362257320986
but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for	2.4714913777396603
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed	2.24256291603673
or had you intended any more serious consequence	1.9518182536425368
"my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me	2.8768226616881556
my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made	2.6826957952797255
"shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to <unk> her	2.7132129314178863
"i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth	1.9119215961731593
but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly	3.0056048999430716
"and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did	2.804555660072767
but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected	2.822267531114176
you supposed more than really existed	1.5930125135173692
you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes	2.4595269619523874
how could i be so silly as to wish it	2.5998734224637445
your idea of the ponies is delightful	2.1998764197826675
we will go round the park every day	1.9754286986435947
i am the happiest creature in the world	1.525019608586096
perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice	2.5004180233736966
i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh	2.011565050593936
mr darcy <unk> you all the love in the world that he can spare from me	3.0803842217686768
mr darcy's letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in reply to his last "dear sir "i must trouble you once more for congratulations	2.4244620170823286
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy	1.6473319161105033
console lady catherine as well as you can	2.5201564505961374
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew	2.4906522185917845
he has more to give	1.513929024292644
miss bingley's congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere	2.627517070913551
she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard	2.6670136880752344
jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved	2.8888131790113962
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother's in sending it	2.261403944805715
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	2.499163289781123
before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge	2.5782331556820144
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was <unk> over	2.5442167656598147
at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the <unk> and <unk> civility of her husband	2.1187853261287715
he bore it however with admirable calmness	2.047923916062441
he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <unk> of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st james's with very decent composure	2.543345761304649
if he did <unk> his <unk> it was not till sir william was out of sight	3.3819090117428736
mrs philips's <unk> was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar	2.053525026457146
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant	2.8308554061155657
elizabeth did all she could to <unk> him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley	1.4330125702369627
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters	2.4869212065631725
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed	2.19875074591997
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do	2.447377432616769
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth	2.5095598431230517
in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great	2.4581042771732866
she was not of so <unk> a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia's example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less <unk>	2.759560474741872
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going	2.2758459260747883
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet's being quite unable to sit alone	2.7473966353805475
mary was obliged to <unk> more with the world but she could still <unk> over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by <unk> between her sisters' beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she <unk> to the change without much <unk>	2.023589647725157
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no <unk> from the marriage of her sisters	2.7253459599387013
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <unk> and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune	2.085205857248754
the <unk> letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished	2.834564393101244
the letter was to this effect "my dear lizzy "i wish you joy	2.623080343111839
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy	3.045788180532354
it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us	3.2023262172275655
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help	3.131509702452539
any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not	2.8856163480672596
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	2.5242373624062644
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them	2.7772914939612696
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and <unk> of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their <unk>	1.7782794100389228
their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme	2.4299965059478352
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a <unk> situation and always spending more than they ought	2.752137677625201
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her's lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her	2.6614275646068246
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth's sake he assisted him farther in his profession	2.3797268152349136
lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or <unk> and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley's good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone	1.9187520990478337
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage but as she thought it advisable to <unk> the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as <unk> and paid off every <unk> of civility to elizabeth	1.9952623149688797
pemberley was now georgiana's home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see	2.4782462828840357
he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry	2.6567371456402373
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way	2.2024738630125507
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <unk> with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	2.777830206270176
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end	1.8957356524063758
but at length by elizabeth's persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that <unk> which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	1.474142020110622
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms	2.3461981253289883
darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of <unk> them	2.761699813343848
transcriber's note <unk> and <unk> changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book	2.8379038388983027
