135.25344280403766
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now	14.251026703029982
"lizzy " said he "what are you doing	74.98942093324558
"mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself	74.98942093324558
very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same	3.162277660168379
but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err	2.543345761304649
<unk> and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them	3.433320018281994
"you dislike an argument and want to silence this	46.41588833612778
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent	138.94954943731372
he heard her with astonishment	1000.0000000000003
our situation with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are	3.290344562312668
i shall never forget her appearance this morning	74.98942093324558
no principle of either would be <unk> by my marriage with mr darcy	14.251026703029982
their reception at home was most kind	138.94954943731372
the <unk> or <unk> of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining <unk>	8.659643233600654
her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted <unk> of their increasing intimacy and ventured to <unk> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter	2.942727176209282
cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction	316.22776601683785
"perhaps we might be deceived	1000.0000000000003
he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <unk>	2.610157215682537
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise	2.610157215682537
we acted with the best intentions	316.22776601683785
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections	14.251026703029982
"i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another <unk>	6.812920690579612
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham	6.158482110660263
"but you forget mama " said elizabeth "that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him	4.216965034285822
"you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion	3.775053205324394
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and <unk> heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him	2.3713737056616555
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most <unk> composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure	2.232735148777284
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here	3.433320018281994
do let me ask my partner to introduce you	46.41588833612778
"as i did the other day " said elizabeth with a conscious smile "very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that	3.9810717055349727
come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly	6.812920690579612
"perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you	6.812920690579612
you provide in accordance with paragraph	316.22776601683785
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more <unk> and less <unk> than the other had ever seen him	2.761699813343848
"you are quite right	4.690846963299355
"yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement	11.787686347935871
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from <unk> to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the <unk> who said "if you are looking for my master ma'am he is walking towards the little copse	1.8329807108324359
"if your master would marry you might see more of him	23.1012970008316
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bennet give up the point	6.812920690579612
no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it	6.812920690579612
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty	3.9810717055349727
so much the better	1.197220833830727
"i must ask whether you were surprised	138.94954943731372
elizabeth was <unk> enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain	5.623413251903491
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill	17.782794100389225
she smiled but made no answer	316.22776601683785
you have liked many a <unk> person	138.94954943731372
"i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever	6.158482110660263
yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth	17.782794100389225
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the <unk> of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it	1.8529220216409523
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening	3.162277660168379
but we must <unk> the tide of malice and <unk> into the wounded <unk> of each other the <unk> of sisterly consolation	4.8063808630643905
i am most seriously displeased	1000.0000000000003
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <unk> them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance	2.232735148777284
"i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the <unk> and public places	5.179474679231211
<unk> upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all	10.0
my faults according to this <unk> are heavy indeed	46.41588833612778
we had better not mention it	316.22776601683785
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world	4.216965034285822
again his astonishment was <unk> and he looked at her with an expression of <unk> incredulity and mortification	6.812920690579612
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me	31.6227766016838
"if we make haste " said lydia as they walked along "perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes	4.8063808630643905
"they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine	10.0
i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection	8.659643233600654
"i had much rather go in the coach	74.98942093324558
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and <unk> manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment	3.290344562312668
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home	3.046989570903508
they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private <unk> in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of <unk> with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others	1.8529220216409523
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr darcy's conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <unk> throughout the whole	2.1187853261287715
at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not	10.0
on mr and mrs gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness	2.761699813343848
they were able to love each other even as well as they intended	14.251026703029982
"very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business	3.433320018281994
mr collins was carefully <unk> them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly <unk> them	3.046989570903508
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added "i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old	2.321954250288982
as they drove to mr gardiner's door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it <unk> and lovely as ever	2.154434690031884
you ought all to have learned	316.22776601683785
she enquired after his sister but could do no more	31.6227766016838
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement	31.6227766016838
it will save me a world of trouble and economy	31.6227766016838
it cannot be concealed from any one	138.94954943731372
you see how continually we are engaged there	74.98942093324558
had i known what i ought what i dared to do	23.1012970008316
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and <unk> its extent	2.4244620170823286
she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done	8.659643233600654
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge	11.787686347935871
but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not	3.046989570903508
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings lydia flew about the house in <unk> ecstacy calling for every one's congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the <unk> kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	2.023589647725157
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment	5.623413251903491
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said "sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	4.489251258218605
the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light	3.046989570903508
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected	17.782794100389225
and you are never to <unk> out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner	3.775053205324394
i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before	2.543345761304649
two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them	3.433320018281994
this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day	6.158482110660263
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of <unk> on mr collins's side and as many bows on sir william's they departed	3.046989570903508
her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted	23.1012970008316
who could about such a <unk> little <unk> thing	46.41588833612778
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively <unk> manner of talking to her brother	2.942727176209282
i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them	2.610157215682537
he was <unk> his memory with <unk> and noble names	31.6227766016838
"my motive for cautioning you is as follows	74.98942093324558
my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us	17.782794100389225
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane	3.290344562312668
he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it	14.251026703029982
but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant	5.623413251903491
you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it	11.787686347935871
i will try again	4.123495529547183
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth's mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	3.593813663804627
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was <unk> and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil	3.593813663804627
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <unk> you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning	1.9187520990478337
"and of this place " thought she "i might have been mistress	17.782794100389225
but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy	14.251026703029982
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required	4.489251258218605
charlotte says she hardly ever does	316.22776601683785
all was joy and kindness	1000.0000000000003
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	74.98942093324558
to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate	23.1012970008316
it would be dreadful	7.99362074616718
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters	1.8957356524063758
my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be <unk> his father's favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for	2.761699813343848
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before	4.216965034285822
"but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit	5.623413251903491
"'tis an etiquette i despise " said he	74.98942093324558
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she <unk> a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his <unk> as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions	2.154434690031884
but i confess they would have no charms for me	31.6227766016838
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley's name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged	2.761699813343848
this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married	17.782794100389225
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain	31.6227766016838
they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went <unk> on with him alone	2.6826957952797255
at length the parsonage was <unk>	316.22776601683785
her ladyship's carriage is <unk> ordered for us	74.98942093324558
mr darcy was <unk> him with <unk> wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility	3.775053205324394
"that is very true " said elizabeth "though it had not occurred to me before	10.0
the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd	23.1012970008316
his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them	3.162277660168379
one does not know what to think	3.314010698688316
how is half such a sum to be repaid	46.41588833612778
darcy said nothing at all	1000.0000000000003
"it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them	6.812920690579612
she directly replied "you need not be frightened	74.98942093324558
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her <unk> and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	2.192345972483447
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room	11.787686347935871
he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention	7.626985859023444
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him	10.0
i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you	7.626985859023444
your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come	17.782794100389225
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged	3.593813663804627
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back	11.787686347935871
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself	6.158482110660263
i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have <unk> domestic felicity in so <unk> a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly	1.566048452832833
"she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this <unk>	11.787686347935871
my mind was more agreeably engaged	316.22776601683785
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister	17.782794100389225
though our kind uncle has done something towards <unk> him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced	3.9810717055349727
we had better go into the <unk>	138.94954943731372
here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell	11.787686347935871
"how can you be smiling so lizzy	138.94954943731372
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any <unk> under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential <unk> or <unk> damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage	2.3713737056616555
as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement	4.489251258218605
you refuse then to oblige me	316.22776601683785
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth	23.1012970008316
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	2.761699813343848
"when is your next ball to be lizzy	74.98942093324558
i dare say the <unk> upon mrs <unk> gown " here she was interrupted again	10.0
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long	11.787686347935871
he seldom appeared really animated	1000.0000000000003
"in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere	14.251026703029982
but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself	7.626985859023444
"no " said her father <unk> a fool if he takes her with a <unk> less than ten thousand pounds	5.623413251903491
how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd	23.1012970008316
but with me it is not so	138.94954943731372
and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room	3.9810717055349727
"i would by no means <unk> any pleasure of yours " he coldly replied	11.787686347935871
why should they try to influence him	138.94954943731372
mrs bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again	3.9810717055349727
could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected	3.290344562312668
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites	1.79571449437164
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins's wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness	3.9810717055349727
and yet how many things have happened	138.94954943731372
"i have been making the tour of the park " he replied "as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage	3.290344562312668
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said "and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting	3.9810717055349727
but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion	3.593813663804627
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their <unk>	14.251026703029982
i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately	8.659643233600654
my dear dear jane i am so happy	74.98942093324558
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	2.761699813343848
in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other	7.626985859023444
but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked	5.179474679231211
younger sons cannot marry where they like	138.94954943731372
when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty	6.812920690579612
but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me	23.1012970008316
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee	4.216965034285822
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever	23.1012970008316
there is one point on which i want your advice	31.6227766016838
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too	46.41588833612778
in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	6.812920690579612
they saw him often and to his other <unk> was now added that of general <unk>	8.659643233600654
they had long wished to see him	138.94954943731372
the officers may not be so pleasant in general 's regiment	23.1012970008316
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing and <unk> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives	4.489251258218605
let me mend it for you	316.22776601683785
"now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse " said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife	3.290344562312668
we are each of an <unk> <unk> disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will <unk> the whole room and be handed down to <unk> with all the <unk> of a <unk>	2.610157215682537
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's he might become a very agreeable companion	1.8957356524063758
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and <unk> to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his <unk>	2.848035868435802
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can't think	17.782794100389225
"no she would go home	1000.0000000000003
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round	14.251026703029982
for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn	6.158482110660263
she dared not even mention that gentleman	138.94954943731372
at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward	11.787686347935871
"i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want	14.251026703029982
" you began the evening well charlotte " said mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas	6.812920690579612
but you do not know all	316.22776601683785
mrs collins did i tell you of lady <unk> calling yesterday to thank me	11.787686347935871
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot	1.7782794100389228
<unk> " observed mary who <unk> herself upon the solidity of her reflections "is a very common failing i believe	5.623413251903491
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that	14.251026703029982
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you	11.787686347935871
miss bennet i insist on being satisfied	138.94954943731372
"you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns " said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour	4.8063808630643905
i was ready to die of laughter	138.94954943731372
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness	31.6227766016838
"i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party	6.158482110660263
but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle	2.6826957952797255
"yes indeed and received no <unk> pleasure from the sight	31.6227766016838
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it	14.251026703029982
"but people themselves <unk> so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever	6.812920690579612
they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either	14.251026703029982
and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married	3.046989570903508
elizabeth said no more but her mind could not <unk>	31.6227766016838
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place	17.782794100389225
she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth	6.812920690579612
what am i to do	1.3369682684873119
i beg you will not go	316.22776601683785
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c	4.8063808630643905
the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now	2.321954250288982
"do not give way to useless alarm " added he "though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain	3.162277660168379
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and <unk> she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment at her being so thin and so small	2.321954250288982
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world	14.251026703029982
i shall like it of all things	138.94954943731372
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	4.216965034285822
she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over	3.9810717055349727
the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	2.761699813343848
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over	3.290344562312668
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcy's proposals	4.489251258218605
i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point	10.0
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat <unk> and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> soon collected them round the table	1.4616223148107232
now was the moment for her resolution to be <unk> and while her courage was high she immediately said "mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your's	2.085205857248754
exclaimed elizabeth "you are too good	316.22776601683785
"i like her appearance " said elizabeth struck with other ideas	23.1012970008316
i wonder who first discovered the <unk> of poetry in driving away love	14.251026703029982
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been <unk> from the world in some distant farm house	2.610157215682537
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have <unk> such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin's <unk>	1.968419447286612
"how strange this is	5623.413251903491
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection	5.179474679231211
she will be married	1.8274379087829653
every kind of pride must <unk> from the connection	46.41588833612778
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a <unk> denial and ride off as fast as i could	2.085205857248754
i hope she will turn out well	138.94954943731372
you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it	11.787686347935871
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency	7.626985859023444
the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters' and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt	1.701254279852589
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance <unk> with them many instructions on execution and taste	7.626985859023444
"you shall have it in few words	138.94954943731372
you never see a fault in any body	74.98942093324558
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women	2.543345761304649
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it	3.775053205324394
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other <unk> which led me on i shall not attempt to deny	3.9810717055349727
"i should not be surprised " said darcy "if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers	4.8063808630643905
it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed <unk> which brought them again after some time in a descent among <unk> woods to the edge of the water in one of its <unk> parts	2.6826957952797255
"and are they upon such terms as for her to <unk> the real truth	11.787686347935871
not one party or scheme or any thing	74.98942093324558
what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy	31.6227766016838
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of <unk> and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me	2.3713737056616555
i do think it is the <unk> thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it	2.192345972483447
at length darcy spoke and in a <unk> manner said "mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain	2.610157215682537
this information however startled mrs bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so	2.321954250288982
let me congratulate you on a very important <unk> the colour now <unk> into elizabeth's cheeks in the <unk> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was <unk> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued "you look conscious	1.701254279852589
he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex	11.787686347935871
pray do not talk of that odious man	74.98942093324558
i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off	10.0
your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with	3.775053205324394
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	6.158482110660263
i do not trust my own partiality	138.94954943731372
"my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way	4.8063808630643905
for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	8.659643233600654
other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose <unk> sermons	17.782794100389225
i would not trust you so near it as <unk> <unk> for fifty pounds	11.787686347935871
the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and <unk> the prospects of mr wickham	2.085205857248754
kitty run down and order the carriage	138.94954943731372
mrs collins knew not what to make of him	46.41588833612778
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this	23.1012970008316
"but what is to be done about pemberley	74.98942093324558
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes	5.623413251903491
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this	2.3713737056616555
as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present <unk> of good will are highly <unk> and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	1.5947870582948211
they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better	6.812920690579612
"to jane herself " she exclaimed "there could be no possibility of objection	14.251026703029982
"but you how are you	1000.0000000000003
he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure "i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you	2.4244620170823286
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <unk> circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her <unk> and steady candour always <unk> for <unk> and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men	1.9429496147158305
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it	3.9810717055349727
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me	3.775053205324394
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived	11.787686347935871
"a man who had felt less might	138.94954943731372
though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected	6.158482110660263
"on the evening before my going to london " said he "i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago	3.593813663804627
"no but it must be done soon	138.94954943731372
"but " he added "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here	3.046989570903508
his apparent partiality had <unk> his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else	7.626985859023444
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to <unk> these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all	2.3713737056616555
now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence	31.6227766016838
they will take care not to <unk> their income	46.41588833612778
words were insufficient for the <unk> of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <unk>	3.046989570903508
he made no answer	1.04337921982225
"i am not one and twenty	316.22776601683785
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance	8.659643233600654
eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress	2.6826957952797255
"i beg your pardon " replied miss bingley turning away with a <unk>	14.251026703029982
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield	2.4244620170823286
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness	5.179474679231211
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before "i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate	2.942727176209282
my feelings in every respect forbid it	138.94954943731372
you are safe from me	1000.0000000000003
her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable	6.812920690579612
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house	4.489251258218605
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want	2.2758459260747883
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas	14.251026703029982
elizabeth silently attended her	5623.413251903491
a flirt too in the worst and <unk> degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and <unk> of her mind wholly unable to <unk> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite	2.085205857248754
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship <unk> that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her	2.085205857248754
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more	10.0
the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	2.4816289228368253
were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express	6.158482110660263
i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his <unk>	17.782794100389225
i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present <unk> and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy <unk> for which i have pledged myself	2.321954250288982
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	5.179474679231211
bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter	11.787686347935871
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man	17.782794100389225
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the <unk> by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her <unk> and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother's hands lydia's expences had been very little within that sum	1.9952623149688797
"and mary king is safe	1000.0000000000003
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to <unk> with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	1.4942339672143998
<unk> it aloud " said their father "for i hardly know myself what it is about	8.659643233600654
she often tried to provoke darcy into <unk> her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	4.216965034285822
cried elizabeth <unk> from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without <unk> a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared	2.321954250288982
it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself	2.2758459260747883
to know that her daughter would be married was enough	31.6227766016838
mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would <unk> his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr bennet and prepared for backgammon	1.7615770326037883
elizabeth could not but look surprised	316.22776601683785
and what sort of young lady is she	74.98942093324558
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion <unk> too	23.1012970008316
not a soul knew of it but <unk>	74.98942093324558
she then took a large house in <unk> street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings	7.626985859023444
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine	2.1187853261287715
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another	2.023589647725157
society has claims on us all and i <unk> myself one of those who consider intervals of <unk> and amusement as desirable for every body	3.9810717055349727
mr philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before	7.626985859023444
i have not been in the habit of <unk> disappointment	31.6227766016838
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit	2.4816289228368253
<unk> forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia's side but nothing to give him any alarm	4.8063808630643905
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification <unk> on such a research in which <unk> had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally <unk> the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	1.615598098439874
their powers of conversation were considerable	316.22776601683785
i am sick of them all	316.22776601683785
elizabeth after slightly <unk> it went to a window to enjoy its prospect	14.251026703029982
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield	2.2758459260747883
a lady's imagination is very rapid it <unk> from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment	6.158482110660263
but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most <unk> character	6.158482110660263
from their infancy they have been intended for each other	31.6227766016838
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <unk>	4.489251258218605
"come here child " cried her father as she appeared	31.6227766016838
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too	3.433320018281994
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received	3.9810717055349727
how merry we shall be together when we meet	46.41588833612778
do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind	6.158482110660263
it <unk> but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before	1.6744824380115346
"let me be rightly understood	1000.0000000000003
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and <unk> to persuade you that he does not care about you	4.216965034285822
if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy	8.659643233600654
i am sure i <unk> get a wink of sleep all night	17.782794100389225
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <unk>	11.787686347935871
well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day	2.761699813343848
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident	46.41588833612778
<unk> resentment is a shade in a character	74.98942093324558
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	138.94954943731372
that tall proud man	5623.413251903491
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the <unk> of an intercourse renewed after many years <unk>	2.321954250288982
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	1.8139306939110624
but you know married women have never much time for writing	23.1012970008316
and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much	11.787686347935871
such an openness and gentleness in his manner	74.98942093324558
they were therefore to go	1000.0000000000003
miss darcy was tall and on a larger <unk> than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance <unk> and <unk>	3.593813663804627
"how hard it is in some cases to be believed	31.6227766016838
"well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister " for mrs philips first brought her the news	6.158482110660263
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communication would therefore do for all	10.0
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball	1.9187520990478337
it is just as he <unk>	316.22776601683785
on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our <unk> at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh's foot <unk> that she said <unk> collins you must marry	2.4816289228368253
the girls stared at their father	316.22776601683785
"no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did	11.787686347935871
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by <unk> a <unk> or covering a <unk>	4.8063808630643905
the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them	31.6227766016838
"and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good " added kitty	6.812920690579612
after a short pause her companion added "you are too generous to trifle with me	10.0
he <unk> and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to <unk> whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear	2.154434690031884
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <unk> were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture	3.433320018281994
have not you always hated him	316.22776601683785
"you may readily comprehend " she added "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time	2.4244620170823286
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities	5.179474679231211
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family	10.0
she had a sister married to a mr philips who had been a <unk> to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade	2.6826957952797255
"you are rather disposed to call his interference officious	46.41588833612778
"but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about	5.623413251903491
was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil	23.1012970008316
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	17.782794100389225
"yes ma'am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as <unk> to the poor	5.623413251903491
what could she mean by it	316.22776601683785
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and <unk> <unk>	3.593813663804627
"lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use	5.623413251903491
she answered him with cold civility	316.22776601683785
"though it is difficult " said jane "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit	3.046989570903508
but the clothes the wedding clothes	316.22776601683785
"he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me	4.8063808630643905
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph	1.8957356524063758
she liked him too little to care for his approbation	31.6227766016838
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth <unk> lest her mother should be exposing herself again	5.623413251903491
"did you go by the village of <unk>	74.98942093324558
her hair so <unk> so <unk>	316.22776601683785
you are charmingly <unk> and appear to uncommon advantage	46.41588833612778
my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did	3.9810717055349727
did you see him while you were at lambton	46.41588833612778
it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon	4.489251258218605
thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room	2.232735148777284
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper	17.782794100389225
but i must tell you how it went off	46.41588833612778
during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <unk> by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	2.085205857248754
when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish	17.782794100389225
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us	11.787686347935871
the supposition did not pain her	316.22776601683785
i am very glad you liked her	138.94954943731372
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds	3.162277660168379
as long as she <unk> there it is all very well	23.1012970008316
"i am thinking of what you have been telling me " said she	14.251026703029982
their first subject was the <unk> of the rosings party	31.6227766016838
"aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to	3.290344562312668
they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	4.8063808630643905
"i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family	17.782794100389225
they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain	2.942727176209282
jane's temper was not <unk> and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	2.761699813343848
cried elizabeth when she had finished it	2.3135000945841235
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend's dislike would <unk> if she could suppose him to be in her power	1.5947870582948211
"i will not be interrupted	8.638496042472608
ten thousand a year	1.007907090624139
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley	14.251026703029982
"upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by <unk>	6.812920690579612
"you can now have nothing farther to say " she resentfully answered	17.782794100389225
yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care	6.812920690579612
"have you any other objection " said elizabeth "than your belief of my indifference	11.787686347935871
lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her	7.626985859023444
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter	8.659643233600654
he was fond of the country and of books and from these <unk> had arisen his principal <unk>	6.812920690579612
at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance	5.623413251903491
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was	23.1012970008316
but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion	2.761699813343848
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be <unk> to you to let them go alone	4.489251258218605
pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen	6.812920690579612
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not <unk> have alarmed her	5.179474679231211
"if you will thank me " he replied "let it be for yourself alone	11.787686347935871
"but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out	5.179474679231211
mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many	3.433320018281994
the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day <unk> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense	2.192345972483447
yours ever "caroline bingley	5623.413251903491
it <unk> me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction	7.626985859023444
on the gentlemen's appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance	3.046989570903508
the possibility of his having really endured such <unk> was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained	1.9429496147158305
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister <unk> for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out "oh papa what news	2.543345761304649
another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night <unk> and <unk> gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty <unk> away	2.4816289228368253
"i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him	2.4244620170823286
the particulars i reserve till we meet	138.94954943731372
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken	74.98942093324558
"well lizzy " continued her mother soon afterwards "and so the collinses live very comfortable do they	7.626985859023444
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars	3.775053205324394
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it	4.216965034285822
in lydia's imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of <unk> happiness	14.251026703029982
when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister	3.9810717055349727
i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy	74.98942093324558
what is it about	5.237252858592992
why is not every body as happy	138.94954943731372
"no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else	6.812920690579612
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals	1.701254279852589
"my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much	7.626985859023444
lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane's beauty	17.782794100389225
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield	4.489251258218605
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family	5.623413251903491
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else	4.489251258218605
<unk> you then persuaded yourself that i should	74.98942093324558
he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected	17.782794100389225
"i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young man's <unk> in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself	2.053525026457146
you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be	4.8063808630643905
"my dear madam " he replied "this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall <unk> myself of it as soon as possible	2.4816289228368253
however he wrote some <unk> on her and very pretty they were	17.782794100389225
the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him	14.251026703029982
bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy	3.290344562312668
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house	4.216965034285822
"as often as i can	1000.0000000000003
"and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over	2.942727176209282
how are you all	5623.413251903491
if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her <unk> spirits and of teaching her that her present <unk> are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment	2.321954250288982
when mr collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten	3.290344562312668
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she <unk> about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two	4.489251258218605
she was dying to know what could be his <unk> and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him	5.623413251903491
seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence	7.626985859023444
the happiest wisest most reasonable end	316.22776601683785
<unk> told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so	10.0
"i think she will	5623.413251903491
"not that i shall though " she added to herself as she finished the letter "and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to <unk> and <unk> to find it out	2.2758459260747883
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country	17.782794100389225
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise <unk> by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and <unk> pass away	3.046989570903508
after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read	11.787686347935871
but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit	14.251026703029982
i can recal nothing worse	1000.0000000000003
but i will not <unk> you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks	6.812920690579612
she performed her part indeed without much <unk> but mrs bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage	6.158482110660263
is not it so mrs bennet	316.22776601683785
mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together	14.251026703029982
at length she spoke again	1000.0000000000003
"you used us abominably ill " answered mrs hurst "in running away without telling us that you were coming out	5.623413251903491
"these are heavy misfortunes " replied elizabeth	138.94954943731372
and she rose as she spoke	316.22776601683785
thoughtlessness want of attention to other people's feelings and want of resolution will do the business	8.659643233600654
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november th by four o'clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day	1.566048452832833
we do not suffer by accident	316.22776601683785
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so <unk> with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and <unk> of her own family	2.610157215682537
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame	8.659643233600654
they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry	31.6227766016838
she replied in the affirmative	1000.0000000000003
"i often think " said she "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends	7.626985859023444
"have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity	23.1012970008316
where shall you change horses	1000.0000000000003
it became her turn to listen	316.22776601683785
but your arts and <unk> may in a moment of <unk> have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family	3.9810717055349727
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it	10.0
i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction	8.659643233600654
"it will be her turn soon to be teazed " said miss lucas	14.251026703029982
not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people's remarks	14.251026703029982
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce	2.4816289228368253
but the fact is that being as i am to <unk> this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years	1.615598098439874
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related	46.41588833612778
redistribution is subject to the trademark license especially <unk> redistribution	31.6227766016838
mrs bennet was restored to her usual <unk> serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the <unk> office another regiment should be quartered in meryton	1.5483652565854986
her father <unk> by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and <unk> mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	2.192345972483447
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner	3.9810717055349727
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his <unk> when he speaks	14.251026703029982
in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account	4.489251258218605
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	23.1012970008316
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption	11.787686347935871
he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling	2.761699813343848
"but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere	3.593813663804627
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of <unk> and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her <unk> <unk>	1.5013107289081733
i thank you for explaining it so fully	74.98942093324558
that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough <unk> for him to see her without some danger	3.290344562312668
i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible	2.610157215682537
"it must have been his sister's doing	138.94954943731372
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl	23.1012970008316
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together	2.4816289228368253
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of <unk> a wife as i certainly did	2.232735148777284
it is what every body says	316.22776601683785
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and <unk> forward with eagerness pronounced her name	5.623413251903491
it was as follows "my dear sir "i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous <unk> you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire	2.192345972483447
the others have been gone on to <unk> these three weeks	23.1012970008316
had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family	6.158482110660263
"a gentleman and a stranger	1000.0000000000003
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule	11.787686347935871
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again	11.787686347935871
not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room	2.232735148777284
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the <unk> was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <unk>	2.4244620170823286
your <unk> makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a <unk>	4.8063808630643905
but when they had withdrawn he said to her "mrs bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding	2.942727176209282
elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	3.593813663804627
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	2.321954250288982
so near a <unk> to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart	4.8063808630643905
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an <unk> and anxious attention while she added "when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood	1.8738174228603839
your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together	5.179474679231211
if he could any how discover at what house the <unk> had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach	2.3713737056616555
"my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	31.6227766016838
said charlotte as soon as he was gone	74.98942093324558
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather <unk> no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer	2.6826957952797255
"that is the most unforgiving speech " said elizabeth "that i ever heard you utter	10.0
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns	5.623413251903491
he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they <unk> with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy	1.7455628235338618
when the <unk> struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so	8.659643233600654
mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them	11.787686347935871
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingley's heart were entertained	4.489251258218605
do not wish me such an evil	138.94954943731372
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an <unk> of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	3.290344562312668
i am not at all afraid of her dying	46.41588833612778
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	2.6826957952797255
do any thing rather than marry without affection	74.98942093324558
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an <unk> of mr darcy's house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture	3.162277660168379
you had much better dance	1000.0000000000003
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share	3.593813663804627
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation	6.812920690579612
have you heard from my uncle	316.22776601683785
she is unfortunately of a sickly <unk> which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who <unk> her education and who still <unk> with them	2.2758459260747883
did she call to refuse her consent	138.94954943731372
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever <unk>	14.251026703029982
"i have found out " said he "by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness	4.216965034285822
"about a month " said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand	3.593813663804627
we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine	5.179474679231211
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a <unk> fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered <unk> to the repeated <unk> of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene	1.5160826983319609
as for jane her anxiety under this <unk> was of course more painful than elizabeth's but whatever she felt she was desirous of <unk> and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to	2.610157215682537
"but upon my honour i do not	138.94954943731372
said he "that is rather singular	316.22776601683785
the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hour's tête à tête with mrs bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her <unk> very <unk> smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on	1.6618362775387496
"now i am quite happy " said she "for you will be as happy as myself	8.659643233600654
if i may so express it he has a right to be proud	14.251026703029982
" that is a failing indeed	316.22776601683785
had i been in love i could not have been more <unk> blind	14.251026703029982
how can they suit each other	316.22776601683785
but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham's <unk> all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate	2.2758459260747883
<unk> said darcy "i have made no such pretension	46.41588833612778
he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday	7.626985859023444
a thousand things may arise in six months	74.98942093324558
women fancy admiration means more than it does	74.98942093324558
shall you like to have such a brother	74.98942093324558
but my dear lydia i don't at all like your going such a way off	10.0
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard	31.6227766016838
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	23.1012970008316

mr and mrs gardiner smiled	6.233378180903385
little more than half a day's journey	138.94954943731372
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman	5.623413251903491
"lizzy " cried her mother "remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home	3.775053205324394
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day	2.942727176209282
the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive	3.9810717055349727
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt	74.98942093324558
you may depend upon my seeking no further	74.98942093324558
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible	7.626985859023444
i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind	11.787686347935871
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him	2.085205857248754
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham's attentions	2.3713737056616555
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mother's tea	14.251026703029982
"it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye <unk> so remarkably fine might be copied	3.9810717055349727
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr darcy's civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister	2.023589647725157
said he as he joined her	316.22776601683785
"this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble <unk> and extensive patronage	3.775053205324394
i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word	3.775053205324394
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth	2.192345972483447
i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir	17.782794100389225
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments	5.179474679231211
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	2.848035868435802
most earnestly did she <unk> to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other	5.623413251903491
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy's farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak	2.942727176209282
"to be sure lizzy " said her aunt "he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham's countenance for his features are perfectly good	3.433320018281994
"your affectionate friend "lydia bennet	1000.0000000000003
but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched	2.2758459260747883
i do not wish to avoid the walk	74.98942093324558
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else	17.782794100389225
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him	2.3713737056616555
her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world	10.0
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object	138.94954943731372
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival	3.9810717055349727
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued "you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it	2.610157215682537
at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas's accidental information that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage	2.4244620170823286
only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time	3.593813663804627
a glass of wine shall i get you one	46.41588833612778
"my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these	17.782794100389225
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford	10.0
"you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew	14.251026703029982
and what can he have to say	138.94954943731372
"can it be possible that he will marry her	46.41588833612778
well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now	3.593813663804627
"then who taught you	5623.413251903491
here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a <unk> which left beauty entirely behind	2.610157215682537
this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret	17.782794100389225
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home	4.216965034285822
for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently	5.179474679231211
"i have sent for you on an affair of importance	31.6227766016838
consider how important every moment is in such a case	31.6227766016838
what hours of <unk> we shall spend	138.94954943731372
"because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it	74.98942093324558
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear	4.489251258218605
does he know his real character	316.22776601683785
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should <unk>	17.782794100389225
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here	11.787686347935871
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had <unk> time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room	1.968419447286612
"in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was	17.782794100389225
"i am trying to make it out	138.94954943731372
and do you really love him quite well enough	46.41588833612778
"you may well warn me against such an evil	46.41588833612778
"lady catherine i have nothing farther to say	74.98942093324558
"i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think	31.6227766016838
at length quite <unk> by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said "how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way	2.154434690031884
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad	23.1012970008316
well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him	11.787686347935871
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most <unk> and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion	3.775053205324394
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the <unk> and go to sleep	5.623413251903491
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet	2.6826957952797255
but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous <unk> boy in the world	2.761699813343848
other schemes too came into her head	138.94954943731372
he drew a chair near her	316.22776601683785
if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all	3.775053205324394
but in what <unk> it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents	6.812920690579612
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life	2.321954250288982
and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away	6.812920690579612
i shall now know how to act	138.94954943731372
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and <unk>	10.0
mr bingley will not be detained in london by them	31.6227766016838
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man	14.251026703029982
mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins began	8.659643233600654
his belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice	2.610157215682537
she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success	6.812920690579612
the express was sent off directly	3.948434094960761
"this is quite shocking	5623.413251903491
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and <unk> <unk> her there	8.659643233600654
limited warranty disclaimer of damages except for the <unk> of replacement or <unk> described in paragraph	8.659643233600654
till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself	3.9810717055349727
it would have been strange if they had	74.98942093324558
"but how did he account for it	138.94954943731372
"i never saw a more promising inclination	138.94954943731372
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	3.290344562312668
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful	138.94954943731372
this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem	5.623413251903491
to miss lydia bennet ' without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing	4.489251258218605
indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them	14.251026703029982
she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his <unk> powers had gained him in the <unk>	2.2758459260747883
"there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome	4.216965034285822
and besides no <unk> of them were to be found on the barnet road	11.787686347935871
i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the <unk>	8.659643233600654
to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others	3.290344562312668
it was kindly meant	5623.413251903491
every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the <unk> of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight	2.543345761304649
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	2.321954250288982
your's very sincerely <unk>	5623.413251903491
"i am exceedingly gratified " said bingley "by your <unk> what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper	4.489251258218605
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	2.6826957952797255
"were it certain that lady catherine would think so " said mr collins very gravely "but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <unk> of you	3.433320018281994
i am perfectly satisfied	1.4534251730169265
the part which i acted is now to be explained	31.6227766016838
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight	11.787686347935871
"i confess " said he "that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings	3.162277660168379
they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance	1.79571449437164
every thing being settled between them mr darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home	3.046989570903508
"project gutenberg" is a registered trademark	316.22776601683785
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	3.9810717055349727
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort	3.9810717055349727
he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful <unk> of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers	2.543345761304649
"that is very true " replied elizabeth "and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine	5.623413251903491
he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said	10.0
that he should even speak to her was amazing	46.41588833612778
i had not an idea of it	138.94954943731372
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	8.659643233600654
"what you ask " said elizabeth "is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter	5.179474679231211
i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony	10.0
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before	2.543345761304649
but though every thing seemed <unk> and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of <unk> and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion	2.3713737056616555
she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so <unk> a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe	1.5483652565854986
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world	5.179474679231211

the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together	2.321954250288982
"he meant i believe " replied jane "to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the <unk> and try if any thing could be made out from them	2.942727176209282
"but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well	10.0

mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many <unk> as they proceeded together up the great staircase	2.232735148777284

this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed	5.179474679231211
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business	5.623413251903491
she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible	1.8139306939110624

it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it	5.179474679231211
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	3.290344562312668
she had high <unk> spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance	2.6826957952797255

the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out	2.3713737056616555
but that is nothing to us	316.22776601683785
"she is happy then " said her father drily "and her residence there will probably be of some duration	6.158482110660263
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was <unk> of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time	3.162277660168379
i hate such false friends	1000.0000000000003
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away	3.433320018281994
she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added "i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again	2.761699813343848
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience	14.251026703029982

they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other	14.251026703029982
but perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	6.812920690579612
the <unk> wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other	2.4816289228368253
she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be <unk> <unk> on the probability of each statement but with little success	3.775053205324394

"i did not think caroline in spirits " were her words "but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london	2.942727176209282
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are <unk> your time with me	6.158482110660263

"if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been " said elizabeth "and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not <unk> of his own	2.154434690031884
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy "miss bennet would not play at all <unk> if she <unk> more and could have the advantage of a london master	2.761699813343848
i did not expect such a compliment	138.94954943731372
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner's long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows "i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory <unk> of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write	1.4384498882876628

"it is wonderful " replied wickham "for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend	4.216965034285822
i knew you would be wishing me joy	74.98942093324558
darcy had walked away to another part of the room	31.6227766016838
he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting	6.158482110660263
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur	2.154434690031884
i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it	14.251026703029982
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character	23.1012970008316
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it	3.9810717055349727
"i am the less surprised at what has happened " replied sir william "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to <unk>	2.6826957952797255

"but does lydia know nothing of this	138.94954943731372

"nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled	8.659643233600654
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon	2.942727176209282
well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone	4.216965034285822
"but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day	8.659643233600654

her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies	3.162277660168379
"when i consider " she added in a yet more agitated voice "that i might have prevented it	6.812920690579612
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret	11.787686347935871

the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	3.593813663804627
i expected you to stay two months	138.94954943731372
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her	6.158482110660263
he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent	4.216965034285822
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its <unk> was owing	3.593813663804627
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of <unk> in that way	8.659643233600654
they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they	23.1012970008316
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling	138.94954943731372
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped	23.1012970008316
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable	17.782794100389225
sir william did not say much	5.73111721696406
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat <unk> she had all the success she expected	2.321954250288982
upon the whole i am much pleased with him	46.41588833612778
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them	3.775053205324394
kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a step	3.290344562312668
"you have a very small park here " returned lady catherine after a short silence	10.0
"but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required	11.787686347935871
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	5.623413251903491
"upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield	5.623413251903491
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such <unk> sisters home could not be <unk> a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	3.046989570903508
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating <unk> in colonel fitzwilliam's manners she believed he might have the best informed mind	1.5570684047537309
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <unk> silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <unk> between them again	3.162277660168379
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me	23.1012970008316

lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room	6.812920690579612
lydia laughed and said "aye that is just like your formality and discretion	14.251026703029982

elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr wickham and herself	10.0
there was another reason too for her opposition	74.98942093324558
