you have delighted us long enough	316.22776601683785
"and yours " he replied with a smile "is wilfully to misunderstand them	14.251026703029982
she approached and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece	6.812920690579612
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not <unk> she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte	3.775053205324394
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others	10.0
elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long <unk> was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and <unk> <unk> at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room	1.6744824380115346
miss bennet i insist on being satisfied	138.94954943731372
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	2.321954250288982
things are settled so <unk>	1000.0000000000003
my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who <unk> him cannot have a proper way of thinking	2.192345972483447
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield	31.6227766016838
when lady catherine and her daughter had <unk> as long as they chose the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to mrs collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered	3.162277660168379
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg tm electronic works	2.6826957952797255
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection	4.489251258218605
"lizzy " cried her mother "remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home	3.775053205324394
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such <unk> as these what would have been her sensations	4.216965034285822
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mother's tea	14.251026703029982
we both know that he has been <unk> in every sense of the word	11.787686347935871
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening	3.162277660168379
but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult	23.1012970008316
<NUMBER> with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project gutenberg tm license	7.626985859023444
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency	7.626985859023444
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the <unk> of the first their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the <unk> reach	1.79571449437164
"i have not the smallest objection to explaining them " said he as soon as she allowed him to speak	5.623413251903491
the first half hour was spent in <unk> up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door	2.2758459260747883
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself	17.782794100389225
anxiety on jane's behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcy's explanation by <unk> bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the <unk> of his confidence in his friend	1.8329807108324359
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <unk> were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture	3.433320018281994
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman like he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners	7.626985859023444
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his <unk> to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm	2.4816289228368253
after a few minutes reflection however she continued "i do remember his <unk> one day at netherfield of the <unk> of his <unk> of his having an unforgiving temper	3.290344562312668
a lively imagination soon settled it all	138.94954943731372
this was agreed to and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	3.433320018281994
"your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you	14.251026703029982
every body declared that he was the <unk> young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always <unk> the appearance of his goodness	3.162277660168379
there is nothing he would not do for her	46.41588833612778
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i <unk> believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father	2.848035868435802
their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were <unk> of dejection	2.6826957952797255
i will not tell you what it is	74.98942093324558
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	2.942727176209282
this part of his intelligence though <unk> by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make	1.6744824380115346
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts <unk> humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	2.848035868435802
my watchfulness has been <unk> and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i <unk> in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance	2.6826957952797255
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world	5.179474679231211
do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind	6.158482110660263
"when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley " said her mother "i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennet's manor	3.046989570903508
"that is a question which i hardly know how to answer	23.1012970008316
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot	1.7782794100389228
"in <unk> your sister i am sure you have pleasure " said bingley "and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	3.775053205324394
mr wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return	6.812920690579612
dear yes but you must own she is very plain	31.6227766016838
mrs bennet <unk> up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good <unk>	2.543345761304649
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	2.761699813343848
lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at <unk> the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party	2.4816289228368253
it seems an hopeless business	1000.0000000000003
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had <unk> engaged their attention	4.8063808630643905
at that moment she cared for no other	74.98942093324558
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	74.98942093324558
"yes indeed " cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood	10.0
many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man	2.192345972483447
but with me it is not so	138.94954943731372
they had several children	5623.413251903491
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said "i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal	2.4816289228368253
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room	5.623413251903491
creating the works from public domain <unk> editions means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works so the foundation and you	3.9810717055349727
"i am sick of mr bingley " cried his wife	31.6227766016838
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go	31.6227766016838
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end	1.8957356524063758
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas	74.98942093324558
and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married	3.046989570903508
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself	23.1012970008316
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay	3.775053205324394
miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a <unk> of <unk> to make merry at her wedding	4.8063808630643905
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been <unk> from alarm and vexation	5.623413251903491
"lady catherine i have nothing farther to say	74.98942093324558
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough	4.8063808630643905
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps <unk> the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while	2.321954250288982
yes i understand you perfectly	1000.0000000000003
"it will be her turn soon to be teazed " said miss lucas	14.251026703029982
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the <unk> ere long	4.216965034285822
his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited	1.8139306939110624
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood	2.023589647725157
you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared	23.1012970008316
i shall see her again	2.2817136442056265
"i do not cough for my own amusement " replied kitty fretfully	17.782794100389225
not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world	5.623413251903491
i do not know who is good enough for him	31.6227766016838
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion <unk> too	23.1012970008316
"the first wish of my heart " said she to herself "is never more to be in company with either of them	4.8063808630643905
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy	46.41588833612778
what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy	31.6227766016838
after a short silence the lady first spoke	74.98942093324558
the possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred	17.782794100389225
well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done	3.9810717055349727
"oh jane take care	5623.413251903491
"yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had	2.942727176209282
with such kind of <unk> of their parties and good <unk> did lydia assisted by kitty's hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn	3.290344562312668
he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask	5.179474679231211
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man	14.251026703029982
she saw herself the object of attention to <unk> and to <unk> of them at present unknown	7.626985859023444
"i am thinking of what you have been telling me " said she	14.251026703029982
elizabeth on her side had much to do	74.98942093324558
you have done all this	1000.0000000000003
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	2.154434690031884
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents	14.251026703029982
"all young ladies accomplished	5623.413251903491
for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the <unk> of my father's will has been <unk> acquainted with every particular of these transactions	2.023589647725157
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said <unk> i congratulate you	2.4816289228368253
the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do	3.162277660168379
mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication	3.046989570903508
the discussion of mr collins's offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	2.761699813343848
she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible	1.8139306939110624
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w	4.8063808630643905
i hate such false friends	1000.0000000000003
two <unk> however were plainly <unk> from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been <unk> used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	2.085205857248754
i am not equal to it	316.22776601683785
mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at all	23.1012970008316
but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her <unk> to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary <unk> to the <unk> of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice	1.6496480740980204
so do not put yourself to inconvenience	138.94954943731372
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball	1.9187520990478337
i cannot understand it	2.2609245548312473
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year	1.7301957388458942
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading	31.6227766016838
"my motive for cautioning you is as follows	74.98942093324558
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins's wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness	3.9810717055349727
"my father and maria are to come to me in march " added charlotte "and i hope you will consent to be of the party	3.9810717055349727
she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to <unk> such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty "come here my love i want to speak to you " took her out of the room	2.3713737056616555
"well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister " for mrs philips first brought her the news	6.158482110660263
she will be married at sixteen	316.22776601683785
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success	5.179474679231211
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening	2.2758459260747883
this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be <unk> by the sister at least all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	2.761699813343848
the happiest wisest most reasonable end	316.22776601683785
he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before	14.251026703029982
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire	31.6227766016838
"and what am i to do on the occasion	46.41588833612778
but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a <unk> chaise	2.232735148777284
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house	4.216965034285822
her father <unk> by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and <unk> mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	2.192345972483447
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before "i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate	2.942727176209282
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much	46.41588833612778
he had to be sure done much	138.94954943731372
will you tell me how long you have loved him	31.6227766016838
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman	5.623413251903491
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do	17.782794100389225
to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers	10.0
each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley's friend without being heard by either of them	2.321954250288982
their fortune on both sides is splendid	138.94954943731372
mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her	17.782794100389225
elizabeth <unk> out and after giving each of them an hasty <unk> hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment immediately met her	3.162277660168379
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful	1.9429496147158305
elizabeth could not <unk> a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head	6.158482110660263
mr collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	31.6227766016838
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of <unk> such reflections	4.216965034285822
after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an <unk> argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men	1.340042721099458
they must have seen them together for ever	74.98942093324558
my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace	2.942727176209282
their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago	4.489251258218605
cried maria after a few minutes silence "it seems but a day or two since we first came	6.812920690579612
"i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever	6.158482110660263
"that would be a good scheme " said elizabeth "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home	4.8063808630643905
had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the <unk> expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it	2.2758459260747883
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church	5.623413251903491
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd	3.9810717055349727
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said "this walk is not wide enough for our party	7.626985859023444
if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before <unk> copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg tm work	2.2758459260747883
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther	6.158482110660263
i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding	17.782794100389225
the possibility of his having really endured such <unk> was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained	1.9429496147158305
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him	31.6227766016838
but mr gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning	3.433320018281994
it was a rational scheme to be sure	74.98942093324558
she wrote cheerfully seemed <unk> with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	10.0
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever	23.1012970008316
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music	6.812920690579612
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before	31.6227766016838
"and of this place " thought she "i might have been mistress	17.782794100389225
change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything	5.623413251903491
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl	2.1187853261287715
you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such <unk> as these	6.158482110660263
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply	8.659643233600654
i must have employment and society	316.22776601683785
i do not wish to avoid the walk	74.98942093324558
he took the hint and soon began with "this seems a very comfortable house	11.787686347935871
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings	7.626985859023444
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme	3.290344562312668
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and <unk> its extent	2.4244620170823286
it cannot last long	5623.413251903491
the letter was to this effect "my dear lizzy "i wish you joy	14.251026703029982
and his sisters are charming women	316.22776601683785
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been <unk> from the world in some distant farm house	2.610157215682537

"i am the less surprised at what has happened " replied sir william "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to <unk>	2.6826957952797255
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information	4.8063808630643905
"what do you mean mr bennet by talking in this way	23.1012970008316
mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh	6.158482110660263
i am perfectly serious in my refusal	138.94954943731372
his countenance rather gained in <unk> and he scarcely opened his lips	17.782794100389225

"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year	17.782794100389225
"it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane " said she	11.787686347935871
never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or <unk> reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings	1.5947870582948211
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no <unk> from the marriage of her sisters	8.659643233600654
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw <unk> in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration	1.4077153669117268
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose	4.216965034285822
"his pride " said miss lucas "does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it	4.489251258218605
much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collins's correspondence for any consideration	8.659643233600654
it was hardly enough but it pleased her	74.98942093324558
"i am sure " she added "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and <unk> a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without <unk> the sweetest temper i ever met with	1.7615770326037883

they crossed it by a <unk> bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a <unk> allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the <unk> <unk> wood which bordered it	1.8957356524063758
she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collins's <unk> of meat were too large for her family	1.79571449437164

since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy	3.162277660168379
mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	4.216965034285822
"i am not afraid of you " said he smilingly	31.6227766016838
she replied in the affirmative	1000.0000000000003
he then said "i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly	10.0
darcy made no answer	5623.413251903491
the stupidity with which he was <unk> by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained	2.023589647725157
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those <unk> which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule	5.179474679231211
"this is quite shocking	5623.413251903491
"is it not clear enough	1000.0000000000003
"if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you	7.626985859023444
she would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable	3.433320018281994
"if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think	6.158482110660263

charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth	23.1012970008316
their visits to mrs philips were now <unk> of the most interesting intelligence	14.251026703029982
"how i long to see her again	138.94954943731372
"and this is always the way with him " she added	23.1012970008316

her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business	2.4244620170823286
"as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear " said mrs bennet "you will wait on him of course	5.623413251903491
my aunt told me so herself on saturday	74.98942093324558
"i will not be interrupted	8.712056174974373
i am impatient to see him	316.22776601683785
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	2.085205857248754
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it	316.22776601683785
"but my dear elizabeth " she added "what sort of girl is miss king	11.787686347935871
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane's happiness and his own would be speedily secured	2.4244620170823286
it was very little less	7.199109182379772
her air was not <unk> nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank	4.8063808630643905
in <unk> lady catherine's expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her <unk> in this interference	4.216965034285822

jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline	11.787686347935871
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me	17.782794100389225
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to <unk> my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken	3.593813663804627

not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bennet give up the point	6.812920690579612
i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will <unk> and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter	3.593813663804627
"i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so <unk> to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been <unk> accordingly	2.232735148777284
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone	6.812920690579612
his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address	3.9810717055349727
miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner	4.8063808630643905
"a man who has once been refused	138.94954943731372
every <unk> <unk> in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther <unk> of mr darcy she could not but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago <unk> his <unk> in the affair that proud and <unk> as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had <unk> brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be <unk> or unjust any thing that spoke him of <unk> or <unk> habits	1.4330125702369627

she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good <unk> engaged mr collins's conversation to herself	4.489251258218605
"but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge	10.0
why does she not come in	316.22776601683785
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented	8.659643233600654
they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain	2.942727176209282
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt	74.98942093324558
compliments always take you by surprise and me never	46.41588833612778
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked up	8.659643233600654
"he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming " said her uncle	17.782794100389225
mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them	11.787686347935871
you had much better dance	1000.0000000000003
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself	6.158482110660263
it was mr collins's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys	1.7301957388458942
the <unk> was <unk> to a turn and everybody said they never saw so <unk> a <unk>	7.626985859023444
it must be an amusing study	316.22776601683785
"if he does not come to me then " said she "i shall give him up for ever	6.812920690579612
in that case he would return no more	74.98942093324558
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what <unk> his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise	1.8329807108324359
his character was decided	7.108426046757986
after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display	1.8738174228603839
let wickham be your man	1000.0000000000003
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of <unk> new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months	2.232735148777284
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas	46.41588833612778
are you out of your senses to be accepting this man	23.1012970008316
he danced only four dances	1.1590534931874608
but what does he say of the living	74.98942093324558
"he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he <unk> that it was left to him conditionally only	3.290344562312668
why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me	8.659643233600654
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	5.623413251903491
"i desire you will do no such thing	74.98942093324558
i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right	3.433320018281994
mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many <unk> as they proceeded together up the great staircase	2.232735148777284
lydia was lydia still <unk> <unk> wild noisy and <unk>	31.6227766016838

i will answer for it he never cared three <unk> about her	17.782794100389225
"i will not trust myself on the subject " replied wickham " i can hardly be just to him	6.158482110660263
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine	2.1187853261287715
" you go to brighton	1000.0000000000003
i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcy's regard	8.659643233600654
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule	11.787686347935871
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together	2.4816289228368253
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him	2.848035868435802
i wish i could see her	3.564618871194993
i told mrs collins so before you came	74.98942093324558
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him	10.0
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for <unk> every repetition of it	6.158482110660263
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation	1.715437896342879
"what is it you mean	1000.0000000000003
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennet's leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying "oh	2.2758459260747883

"but not before they went to brighton	138.94954943731372
she could not bear such suspense and hastily <unk> a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended	2.3713737056616555

mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street	2.543345761304649

elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her	4.8063808630643905
the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hour's tête à tête with mrs bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her <unk> very <unk> smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on	1.6618362775387496

lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room	6.812920690579612
lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father's behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter	1.8329807108324359

mr darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a <unk> sense of her sister's sufferings	4.8063808630643905
he wrote last week to hurry my return	74.98942093324558
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the <unk> change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the <unk> of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father's incredulity and <unk> him to the match	1.5237960002208242
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a <unk> of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family	1.9187520990478337
two days after mr bennet's return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and <unk> that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet "i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask	1.4806572771858608
"tell me once for all are you engaged to him	31.6227766016838

"you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns " said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour	4.8063808630643905

they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit	2.6826957952797255
he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself	4.8063808630643905
"now i am quite happy " said she "for you will be as happy as myself	8.659643233600654

he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand	2.321954250288982
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match	6.158482110660263
the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence	3.290344562312668
she would be in <unk> way you know in that part of the house	11.787686347935871

to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated <unk> as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and <unk> of an elegant female	1.6876124757881479

"nothing is more deceitful " said darcy "than the appearance of humility	17.782794100389225
she added "by far too much	316.22776601683785
if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen	7.626985859023444
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an <unk> of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	3.290344562312668

"you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday	3.9810717055349727
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable	3.046989570903508

he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him	2.3713737056616555
"no but it must be done soon	138.94954943731372

i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their <unk>	14.251026703029982

occupied in observing mr bingley's attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend	3.162277660168379

she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	3.9810717055349727
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic	14.251026703029982
as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its <unk>	6.812920690579612
the supposition did not pain her	316.22776601683785
there was another reason too for her opposition	74.98942093324558
i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve	8.659643233600654
mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus "my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the <unk> of your understanding but <unk> me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the <unk> and those which <unk> the <unk> for give me leave to observe that i consider the <unk> office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained	1.3650078065460138

or had you intended any more serious consequence	74.98942093324558
they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance	1.79571449437164
her mind was less difficult to <unk>	138.94954943731372

"take care lizzy that speech <unk> strongly of disappointment	46.41588833612778

"i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas	2.761699813343848

what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had <unk> <unk> only four months ago would now have been <unk> and gratefully received	2.942727176209282
"you have only proved by this " cried elizabeth "that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition	5.623413251903491
as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the <unk>	1.9429496147158305
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	1.7301957388458942
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder	5.623413251903491
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them	4.8063808630643905

you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham	2.610157215682537
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley's name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged	2.761699813343848
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise <unk> by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and <unk> pass away	3.046989570903508
"that is exactly what i should have supposed of you " said elizabeth	14.251026703029982
mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner	6.812920690579612
the girls stared at their father	316.22776601683785
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over	2.023589647725157
he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded	17.782794100389225

i always had a value for him	138.94954943731372
elizabeth would not oppose such an <unk> and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by <unk> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion	1.968419447286612

"i can much more easily believe mr bingley's being imposed on than that mr wickham should <unk> such a history of himself as he gave me last night names <unk> every thing mentioned without ceremony	2.6826957952797255

when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish	17.782794100389225
then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added <unk> as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is <unk> that one false step <unk> her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <unk> than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	1.6050163175336876

when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses	6.158482110660263
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed	10.0
against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves <unk> long she urged jane to borrow mr bingley's carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made	1.7615770326037883
they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens	11.787686347935871
i must beg therefore to be <unk> no farther on the subject	17.782794100389225
but i must tell you how it went off	46.41588833612778
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame	8.659643233600654
jane was by no means better	316.22776601683785
"when i wrote that letter " replied darcy "i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit	3.162277660168379
it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view	11.787686347935871
she related the subject of the <unk> the <unk> of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain	5.623413251903491
in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done	1.6050163175336876
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no <unk> received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re <unk> the admiration of her former lover	2.6826957952797255
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	1.715437896342879
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a <unk> commission in the shire	1.715437896342879
elizabeth said no more but her mind could not <unk>	31.6227766016838
"very true and if i had my will we should	31.6227766016838
"you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman <unk> the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour	2.154434690031884
his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <unk> as she believed she was considered by the others	2.942727176209282
if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him	8.659643233600654
had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his <unk> for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment <unk> from his horse or his carriage	2.610157215682537
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this	17.782794100389225
elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course	14.251026703029982
"while mary is <unk> her ideas " he continued "let us return to mr bingley	10.0
elizabeth could not help saying "it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so	5.623413251903491
"no really " replied elizabeth "i think there cannot be too little said on the subject	8.659643233600654
by the author of "sense and sensibility	1.0401398711277199
"i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want	14.251026703029982
you promised me to insist upon her marrying him	46.41588833612778
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philips's manners and politeness	8.659643233600654
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey	2.321954250288982
mr collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him	6.812920690579612
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton	6.812920690579612
with them he is remarkably agreeable	316.22776601683785
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	11.787686347935871
miss bingley's letter arrived and put an end to doubt	31.6227766016838
the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months <unk> painful to me	3.162277660168379
what relates to yourself is as follows	138.94954943731372
"my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	31.6227766016838
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and <unk> her disgust of mr collins	8.659643233600654
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate	2.321954250288982
"i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject	5.179474679231211
charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	1.715437896342879
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	4.216965034285822
"miss bingley told me " said jane "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance	7.626985859023444
jane looked a little <unk> than usual but more <unk> than elizabeth had expected	11.787686347935871
though her manner varied however her determination never did	46.41588833612778
it is not likely that money should be very <unk> on either side and it might strike them that they could be more <unk> though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland	2.848035868435802
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be <unk> at and it was rather too early to begin	5.623413251903491
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way	17.782794100389225
"how should you have liked making sermons	138.94954943731372
he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility	2.6826957952797255
but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it	23.1012970008316
one morning about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	1.9187520990478337
"yes ma'am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as <unk> to the poor	5.623413251903491
the party did not supply much conversation	138.94954943731372
miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with <unk> civility "pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton	2.942727176209282
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring	23.1012970008316
i enquired after their brother of course	138.94954943731372
"that it ought not to be attempted	138.94954943731372
does your charge give you much trouble	138.94954943731372
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his <unk> for her as his patroness <unk> with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his <unk> as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and <unk> self importance and humility	1.6496480740980204
he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away	2.2758459260747883
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	4.8063808630643905
she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth	6.812920690579612
how i long to see her	316.22776601683785
not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body	17.782794100389225
every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed <unk> away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time	2.761699813343848
her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating	31.6227766016838
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere	23.1012970008316
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that	14.251026703029982
he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it	14.251026703029982
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it	4.489251258218605
nothing could be more delightful	12.287445537097756
but we considered it we talked of it as impossible	31.6227766016838
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related	46.41588833612778
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley	8.659643233600654
"then who taught you	5623.413251903491
it <unk> but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before	1.6744824380115346
but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first <unk> of her disapprobation	1.8738174228603839
i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's connections	46.41588833612778
the <unk> would be spoilt by <unk> a fourth	46.41588833612778
our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day	10.0
no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very <unk> <unk> for netherfield were got by <unk>	5.623413251903491
the vague and unsettled suspicions which <unk> had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	1.7615770326037883
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before	5.623413251903491
how could his will be <unk>	316.22776601683785
these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite <unk> watching the <unk> on guard and dressing a <unk> and <unk>	3.290344562312668
"true " said mr bennet "but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may <unk> you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it	2.848035868435802
they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private <unk> in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of <unk> with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others	1.8529220216409523
he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be <unk> and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride	3.290344562312668
"and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it	17.782794100389225
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished <unk> of integrity or benevolence that might <unk> him from the attacks of mr darcy or at least by the <unk> of virtue atone for those <unk> errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	1.79571449437164
" you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room " said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	4.8063808630643905
"lizzy you must not do so	316.22776601683785
again she read on	5623.413251903491
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <unk> from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the <unk> and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject	1.5753186734235158
my mother was in <unk> and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done	3.046989570903508
"you are <unk> lizzy	5623.413251903491
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	17.782794100389225
"from what we have seen of him " continued mrs gardiner "i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham	2.543345761304649
i am not at all afraid of her dying	46.41588833612778
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of <unk> muslin and <unk> and would shortly have <unk> some very <unk> orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted	2.2758459260747883
my sisters may write to me	316.22776601683785
mr darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her	138.94954943731372
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance	8.659643233600654
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the <unk> property of some one or other of their daughters	2.053525026457146
all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation	31.6227766016838
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	3.433320018281994
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained	14.251026703029982
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his <unk> about the whole pemberley family are endless	3.290344562312668
perhaps she is full young to be much in company	31.6227766016838
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much <unk> by the possessor and often without any attention to the <unk> of the performance	3.775053205324394
very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same	3.162277660168379
mr bingley will not be detained in london by them	31.6227766016838
"that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline " cried her brother "because he does not write with ease	5.179474679231211
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend's dislike would <unk> if she could suppose him to be in her power	1.5947870582948211
i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy	74.98942093324558
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed	1.539926526059492
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy	31.6227766016838
we had better go into the <unk>	138.94954943731372
her aunt now called her to look at a picture	31.6227766016838
"pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of " cried colonel fitzwilliam	10.0
the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits	10.0
the foundation is <unk> to complying with the laws <unk> <unk> and <unk> donations in all <NUMBER> states of the united states	4.8063808630643905
i beg you will not go	316.22776601683785
from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl	6.812920690579612
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth	31.6227766016838
"we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame <unk> to that evening " said elizabeth	7.626985859023444
mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family	7.626985859023444
"i assure you madam " he replied "that she does not need such advice	11.787686347935871
i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection	2.3713737056616555
if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error	11.787686347935871
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no <unk> the frequent mention of wickham's name	6.812920690579612
i told my sister philips so the other day	46.41588833612778
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy	23.1012970008316
"upon my word sir " cried elizabeth "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration	7.626985859023444
but no letter appeared and she was completely <unk>	46.41588833612778
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters	2.232735148777284
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself	46.41588833612778
he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves	17.782794100389225
if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon	17.782794100389225
of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt	17.782794100389225
any other inconsistencies with modern <unk> have been left as printed	23.1012970008316
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us	10.0
"how hard it is in some cases to be believed	31.6227766016838
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters <unk> on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family	2.3713737056616555
if there were but such another man for you	46.41588833612778
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	138.94954943731372
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments	2.942727176209282
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the <unk> <unk> her coming so far alone	3.433320018281994
"i am not going to run away papa " said kitty fretfully "if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia	3.9810717055349727
<unk> " cried lydia "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss <unk> as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in <unk> library	2.4816289228368253
you will be a very happy woman	138.94954943731372
on reaching the <unk> <unk> above they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and <unk> than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley	1.8957356524063758
"i do i do like him " she replied with tears in her eyes "i love him	7.626985859023444
"some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know	10.0
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with <unk> satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace	2.761699813343848
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield	2.4244620170823286
if she does not object to it why should we	31.6227766016838
i am sure you must feel it so	5.982170816044038
well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it	6.158482110660263
you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters	4.489251258218605
i hope he will overlook it	316.22776601683785
<unk> with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means	5.623413251903491
these recollections will not do at all	138.94954943731372
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	4.216965034285822
with the <unk> concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart	4.489251258218605
you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine	7.626985859023444
oh that i knew how it was	138.94954943731372
mrs bennet was restored to her usual <unk> serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the <unk> office another regiment should be quartered in meryton	1.5483652565854986
"you must not blame my aunt	316.22776601683785
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite <unk> and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had <unk> in his offer to herself	2.232735148777284
the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with	17.782794100389225
the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth's intimate friend	8.659643233600654
"certainly " he replied <unk> his lips	138.94954943731372
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley's regard and said all in her power to <unk> her confidence in it	3.433320018281994
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father	31.6227766016838
jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears	6.812920690579612
any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not	3.593813663804627
her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr darcy's indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much	2.192345972483447
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <unk> shewn	2.4244620170823286
sir william how can you tell such a story	46.41588833612778
but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her	2.942727176209282
how was that possible	5623.413251903491
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend	14.251026703029982
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits	23.1012970008316
and then with a slight bow turned again into the <unk> and was soon out of sight	7.626985859023444
she then took a large house in <unk> street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings	7.626985859023444
"when i am in the country " he replied "i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same	3.593813663804627
"i must go instantly to my mother " she cried	31.6227766016838
the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet's heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property	2.3713737056616555
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it	17.782794100389225
"of a fine stout <unk> love it may	74.98942093324558
whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done <unk>	17.782794100389225
my faults according to this <unk> are heavy indeed	46.41588833612778
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	14.251026703029982
tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my <unk> and have such <unk> such <unk> all over me such <unk> in my side and pains in my head and such <unk> at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day	1.9429496147158305
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine	10.0
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the <NUMBER> per <unk>	2.4244620170823286
no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation	14.251026703029982
but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done	11.787686347935871
"do you prefer reading to cards	316.22776601683785
wickham lydia were all forgotten	1000.0000000000003
you have liked many a <unk> person	138.94954943731372
another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night <unk> and <unk> gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty <unk> away	2.4816289228368253
mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure	17.782794100389225
"why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks	17.782794100389225
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err	1.9952623149688797
"aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to	3.290344562312668
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family	10.0
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions <unk> you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning	1.9187520990478337
when the dancing <unk> however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	2.053525026457146
she is gone down to her uncle at <unk> gone to stay	17.782794100389225
"i have heard much of your master's fine person " said mrs gardiner looking at the picture "it is a handsome face	4.8063808630643905
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment	4.489251258218605
"i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man	10.0
it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the <unk> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	4.489251258218605
it would have suited me in every respect	74.98942093324558
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent	2.321954250288982
i fancy she was wanted about the <unk> <unk>	46.41588833612778
transcriber's note <unk> and <unk> changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book	7.626985859023444
at length the parsonage was <unk>	316.22776601683785
she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it	4.8063808630643905
lydia <unk> as he opened the volume and before he had with very <unk> solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with "do you know mama that my uncle philips <unk> of turning away <unk> and if he does colonel forster will <unk> him	2.192345972483447
but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a <unk> <unk> again	8.659643233600654
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go	5.179474679231211
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease	3.9810717055349727
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me	3.162277660168379
"but he paid her not the smallest attention till her <unk> death made her mistress of this fortune	6.812920690579612
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself	4.8063808630643905
my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says	5.179474679231211
to no creature had it been revealed where <unk> was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own	2.154434690031884
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of <unk> on mr collins's side and as many bows on sir william's they departed	3.046989570903508
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject	23.1012970008316
"i am very sensible madam of the <unk> to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate	3.290344562312668
what will wickham say	5623.413251903491
"it is not mr bingley " said her husband "it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life	4.216965034285822
a little time therefore	5623.413251903491
at length the chaise arrived the <unk> were <unk> on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready	5.179474679231211
you must and shall be married by a special licence	31.6227766016838
"i must think your language too strong in speaking of both " replied jane "and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together	3.433320018281994
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one	31.6227766016838
he can be a <unk> companion if he thinks it worth his while	14.251026703029982
i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him	3.775053205324394
he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us	8.659643233600654
all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again	2.610157215682537
i will only add god bless you	138.94954943731372
make haste make haste	5623.413251903491
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet	5.623413251903491
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active <unk> in her own parish the <unk> concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins and whenever any of the <unk> were disposed to be <unk> discontented or too poor she <unk> forth into the village to settle their <unk> silence their complaints and <unk> them into <unk> and <unk>	1.5753186734235158
your <unk> must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance	3.775053205324394
and to the <unk> of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen	2.610157215682537
this is the estimation in which you hold me	46.41588833612778
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	74.98942093324558
had lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly <unk>	1.9952623149688797
"i am not now to learn " replied mr collins with a formal <unk> of the hand "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first <unk> for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time	1.8139306939110624
"how can you be so silly " cried her mother "as to think of such a thing in all this dirt	5.179474679231211
i will try again	4.251486279199812
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking	11.787686347935871
she saw with the <unk> eye of fancy the <unk> of that gay bathing place covered with officers	6.812920690579612
he has not an ill natured look	138.94954943731372
there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects	7.626985859023444
a small sum could not do all this	74.98942093324558
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley	7.626985859023444
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time	6.812920690579612
"i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him	2.4244620170823286
mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many	3.433320018281994
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed	1.9952623149688797
before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge	3.290344562312668
it was some time however before a smile could be <unk> from jane	14.251026703029982
what is the matter	3.1379507418197368
have not you always hated him	316.22776601683785
you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing	23.1012970008316
having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater <unk> than first <unk> often boast and so <unk> did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were <unk> to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity	1.53174046370208
one seems so <unk> without them	316.22776601683785
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy's in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be <unk> though it could not be <unk> by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning	1.5570684047537309
how much sooner one <unk> of any thing than of a book	17.782794100389225
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself	1.968419447286612
why is not every body as happy	138.94954943731372
have all her friends left her	316.22776601683785
you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as <unk> of derivative works <unk> <unk> and research	6.158482110660263
in spite of her deeply <unk> dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his <unk> language she lost all compassion in anger	1.8529220216409523
she answered with equal indifference and <unk> and the other said no more	14.251026703029982
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added "but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer	1.8957356524063758
"so much the better	1.1115578072595165
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his <unk> and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the <unk> way for happiness	2.761699813343848
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary	46.41588833612778
shall you like to have such a brother	74.98942093324558
miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present	2.085205857248754
they were within twenty <unk> of each other and so <unk> was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight	4.8063808630643905
if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be <unk> for <unk> i must call it	4.8063808630643905
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	2.6826957952797255
"it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single	17.782794100389225
this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret	17.782794100389225
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr philips's	5.179474679231211
"i am all astonishment	5623.413251903491
"true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room	23.1012970008316
"i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that	31.6227766016838
pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night	7.626985859023444
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips	3.593813663804627
i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage	17.782794100389225
"the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting	2.4816289228368253
no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame	8.659643233600654
with <unk> tranquillity he then replied "i have no wish of <unk> that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success	2.761699813343848
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new <unk>	4.489251258218605

he begged pardon for having displeased her	138.94954943731372
but that gentleman " looking at darcy <unk> to think the country was nothing at all	8.659643233600654
"he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me	4.8063808630643905
why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case	11.787686347935871
elizabeth looked archly and turned away	316.22776601683785
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <unk> family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	2.610157215682537
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on	3.593813663804627
that will make <unk> with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him	8.659643233600654
she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle	3.9810717055349727
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and <unk> of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their <unk>	1.7782794100389228
nobody can tell what i suffer	316.22776601683785
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley's voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	3.046989570903508
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of <unk> should not be broken in on	5.179474679231211
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world	4.216965034285822
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began	2.154434690031884
"have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is	46.41588833612778
elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked	46.41588833612778
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon	4.216965034285822
in the <unk> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said "miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room	2.6826957952797255
they will have nothing else to do	138.94954943731372
they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply <unk> on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade	2.942727176209282
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person	3.775053205324394
who instantly taking the alarm set off from b	46.41588833612778
mr collins was eloquent in her praise	138.94954943731372
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in	17.782794100389225
it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself	2.2758459260747883
mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete <unk> over him continued her triumph	10.0
pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to <unk> me from <unk>	4.216965034285822

you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	2.6826957952797255
and having to relate such a thing of his sister	31.6227766016838
"and this " cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room "is your opinion of me	6.158482110660263
"my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of <unk> in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me	2.848035868435802
"if we make haste " said lydia as they walked along "perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes	4.8063808630643905
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste	4.8063808630643905
the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley	17.782794100389225
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table	3.775053205324394
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennet coolly observed "from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the <unk> girls in the country	2.610157215682537
but when they had withdrawn he said to her "mrs bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding	2.942727176209282
our plain manner of living our small rooms and few <unk> and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time <unk>	1.8139306939110624
i had not believed it possible	316.22776601683785
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and <unk> mercenary and the <unk> of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to <unk> at any thing	2.543345761304649
"we have heard only once	1000.0000000000003
i shall like it of all things	138.94954943731372
"pray do my dear miss lucas " she added in a melancholy tone "for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves	2.761699813343848
is not it so mrs bennet	316.22776601683785
they have some of the finest woods in the country	31.6227766016838
"lizzy " said he "i was going to look for you come into my room	10.0
allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety	2.023589647725157
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for <unk> lodge the <unk> are dreadful	5.623413251903491
we have heard nothing from town	316.22776601683785
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the <unk> to the <unk> to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a <unk> in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the <unk> of which he attended himself	1.7615770326037883

it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton <unk> from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and <unk> by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world	1.6876124757881479
i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better	2.942727176209282
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's	14.251026703029982
"that is very strange	7.0484836843139345
as for their mother mr collins's letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters	2.848035868435802
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner	46.41588833612778
"and this is your real opinion	316.22776601683785
"why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent " said she "did he come at all	6.158482110660263
yet it did and even a third	138.94954943731372
"yes " replied wickham "his estate there is a noble one	23.1012970008316
<unk> wore a happier aspect	3.5328529990912347
but as no such delicacy <unk> her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used	2.1187853261287715
but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered "no no stay where you are	5.623413251903491
at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	6.158482110660263
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort	23.1012970008316
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the <unk> and go to sleep	5.623413251903491
upon the whole i am much pleased with him	46.41588833612778
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and <unk> liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day	1.8139306939110624
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was <unk> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	4.489251258218605

"nay " cried bingley "this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning	4.8063808630643905
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern "oh	11.787686347935871
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at <unk> "ah	11.787686347935871
cried elizabeth when she had finished it	138.94954943731372
"you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner	17.782794100389225
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment	5.623413251903491
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world	14.251026703029982
"the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so	17.782794100389225
but it was a hope shortly checked by other <unk> and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	1.968419447286612
brother in law of wickham	5.8293509328831155
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy	6.158482110660263
but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly	5.179474679231211
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh	17.782794100389225
"and i certainly never shall give it	138.94954943731372
wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable	7.626985859023444
"it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it	8.659643233600654
take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one	23.1012970008316
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had <unk> time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room	1.968419447286612
"i deserve neither such praise nor such censure " cried elizabeth "i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things	4.216965034285822
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention which could furnish her with an occasion of <unk> to others	5.179474679231211
at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction	23.1012970008316
mrs bennet was quite disconcerted	13.40297052128669
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the <unk> of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better	1.7615770326037883
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it	6.158482110660263
"i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news	17.782794100389225
to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others	3.290344562312668
the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shewn	6.158482110660263
one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it	11.787686347935871
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be <unk> into it	2.085205857248754
and so she asked the two <unk> to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did	3.162277660168379
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial <unk> absurd	6.812920690579612
there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners <unk> respectability was not to be hastily rejected	2.232735148777284
and if i am that choice why may not i accept him	17.782794100389225
"i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family	17.782794100389225
younger sons cannot marry where they like	138.94954943731372
those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the <unk> light seemed most improbable	8.659643233600654
"upon my word " said her ladyship "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person	6.812920690579612
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour	6.158482110660263
he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said	10.0
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken	74.98942093324558
to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent <unk> of <unk> on the mantle piece the interval of waiting appeared very long	2.321954250288982
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness	31.6227766016838
he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	10.0
"on the evening before my going to london " said he "i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago	3.593813663804627
do let me ask my partner to introduce you	46.41588833612778
i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all	11.787686347935871
you must learn some of my philosophy	138.94954943731372
<unk> forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia's side but nothing to give him any alarm	4.8063808630643905
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object	14.251026703029982
it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham's character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was	2.942727176209282
"can this be mr darcy	1000.0000000000003
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	1.8139306939110624
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed "to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father	3.593813663804627
at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her	2.848035868435802
he has a very <unk> eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him	4.489251258218605
i will speak to her about it myself directly	46.41588833612778
words were insufficient for the <unk> of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <unk>	3.046989570903508
her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted	23.1012970008316
her report was highly favourable	1000.0000000000003
she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all	14.251026703029982
"you must decide for yourself " said elizabeth "and if upon <unk> deliberation you find that the misery of <unk> his two sisters is more than <unk> to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him	2.232735148777284
"but upon my honour i do not	138.94954943731372
mr darcy is engaged to my daughter	138.94954943731372
"but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about	5.623413251903491
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of <unk> and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me	2.3713737056616555
sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as <unk> <unk> as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise	2.321954250288982
"it is evident by this " added jane "that he comes back no more this winter	8.659643233600654
